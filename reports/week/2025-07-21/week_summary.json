When changing the Auto-Generated Context (Saved Material Enrichment) option in Machine Learning from the menu, in my case I want it to be \"High\", but every time I change it, when I check the next day or any time later, or every time the app or os updates, the option selected goes back to \"Medium\". So I don't actually even know if it ever used \"High\", because it always returns the option to \"Medium\".\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
