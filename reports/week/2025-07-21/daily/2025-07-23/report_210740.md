## Common Issues
### 1. Auto-Generated Context Resets to Medium
Users report that the Auto-Generated Context setting in the Pieces desktop app (macOS) repeatedly reverts to "Medium" from "High" after app restarts, OS updates, or periods of inactivity.  The behavior has persisted across multiple builds. It's unclear whether the "High" setting ever takes effect.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the bug causing the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting to revert to 'Medium'. This is the most frequent issue and affects macOS users.
- Monitor the fix for the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting to ensure it resolves the issue permanently and doesn't reoccur in future updates.
- Consider adding a notification or confirmation message within the app when the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting is changed, so users are aware of the change and can verify it persists.
