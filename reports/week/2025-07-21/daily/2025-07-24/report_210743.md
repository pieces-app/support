## Common Issues
### 1. Constant selection, like stuck "shift" or "mouse 1"
Users on Pieces OS 4.3.1 for Windows experience continuous selection, as if "shift" or "mouse 1" is permanently pressed. This affects arrow key navigation and clicking, turning them into selection actions.  Copy-pasting (ctrl+v) is also disabled during this bug. The trigger is currently unknown.
