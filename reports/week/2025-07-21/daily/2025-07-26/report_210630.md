| [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805) | LTM gets gunged up over time | 4.42 |
| [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804) | Unable to generate Workstream Summary | 4.42 |

## Common Issues
### 1. LTM queries fail after extended use
Users report that LTM queries stop working after several weeks of use, returning no results even with a full Workstream.  Clearing LTM data via the button fails. Reinstalling or removing all Pieces data temporarily resolves the issue.  Issue occurs on macOS and Windows.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and address the LTM query failure issue reported by users. This appears to be a recurring problem affecting both macOS and Windows users and requires urgent attention.
- Implement a more robust LTM data clearing mechanism as the current 'Clear LTM Data' button is reported to be ineffective.
- Look into the issue of Workstream Summary generation failure reported on Windows.  The error message suggests a server-side problem that needs investigation.
