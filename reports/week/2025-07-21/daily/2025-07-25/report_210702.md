## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and extensions exhibit unexpected behavior
Users report issues with Pieces OS including persistent selection mode, high resource usage, and Raycast extension incompatibility.  The selection bug involves unintended selection behavior, possibly related to shift/mouse click lock. High resource usage involves RAM/CPU spikes, potentially linked to internet connectivity.  The Raycast extension issue stems from version incompatibility.  Suggested solutions include restarting Pieces OS and updating the Raycast extension.
