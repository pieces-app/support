## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Bugs and Unexpected Behaviors
Users report issues with Pieces OS, including persistent selection mode, high RAM/CPU usage, and auto-generated context resetting to medium.  The selection bug involves unintended selection behavior, possibly related to shift/mouse1 keys. High resource usage may be linked to internet connectivity.  The context setting doesn't retain user preferences. Workarounds include restarting the application and manually adjusting settings.

**Related Issues:**

- [#150](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/150): PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU
- [#801](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/801): Auto Generated Context Always returns to Medium

### 2. PiecesOS Errors and Performance Degradation
Users report issues with PiecesOS, including high RAM/CPU usage, and LTM query failures after prolonged use.  A potential connection with internet connectivity is suspected in the performance issues.  Restarting PiecesOS offers a temporary fix. LTM issues may require clearing LTM data, although the in-app function is reportedly not working.  A common error message points to a problem with the Gemini-pro model access in the project pi3c3s-cloud-server.

- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time

### 3. PiecesOS macOS App Performance Issues
Users are experiencing performance issues with the Pieces macOS app, including slow LTM queries, failure to clear LTM data, and auto-generated context settings reverting to default.  One user reported LTM issues after extended use, resolved by clearing all Pieces data. Another user noted auto-generated context settings not persisting.  Additionally, high RAM/CPU usage has been reported by multiple users, with restarting PiecesOS as a temporary workaround.

### 4. Pieces OS and extensions have compatibility issues
Users report various compatibility issues between Pieces OS, its extensions (like Raycast), and the desktop application. Problems include Raycast extension incompatibility with newer Raycast versions, auto-generated context settings reverting to default, and failure to generate workstream summaries.  Check for updates for Pieces, the desktop app, and extensions. Ensure consistent settings configurations.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the "PiecesOS using too much RAM/spike in CPU" issue (Ticket #150) due to its high activity level and potential impact on users. Investigate the suspected connection with internet connectivity.
- Address the persistent selection bug in Pieces OS (Ticket #803) as it has the highest activity level and severely impacts usability.  Focus on the potential lock on "shift" or "mouse 1" keys.
- Investigate and fix the LTM performance issues (Tickets #805) and data clearing functionality.  The inability to clear LTM data necessitates a complete data removal, impacting user experience.
- Resolve the issue with auto-generated context settings reverting to default (Ticket #801). This recurring problem indicates a persistent bug in settings management.
- Address the Raycast extension incompatibility with newer Raycast versions (Ticket #781) to ensure users can leverage the extension's functionalities.
- Investigate the "Unable to generate Workstream Summary" error (Ticket #804) and the reported error message related to Gemini-pro model access.
