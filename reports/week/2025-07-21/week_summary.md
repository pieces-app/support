## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Bugs: Selection Lock, High Resource Usage, Context Reset
Users report persistent selection lock, preventing normal interaction.  High RAM/CPU usage spikes also occur, potentially linked to internet connectivity.  Restarting Pieces OS is a temporary workaround.  Auto-generated context settings revert to "Medium" despite user changes.

### 2. PiecesOS Errors and Unexpected Behavior
Users report issues with PiecesOS, including high RAM/CPU usage, failure to generate workstream summaries, and auto-generated context settings reverting to default.  The workstream summary and high resource usage issues appear related to a 404 error accessing the Gemini-Pro model. A temporary solution for high resource usage is restarting PiecesOS.  The auto-generated context setting issue is persistent across macOS platforms and multiple builds.

### 3. Pieces OS and extensions have compatibility issues
Users report various compatibility issues between Pieces OS, its extensions (like Raycast), and different operating systems (macOS, Windows). Problems include Raycast extension incompatibility with newer Raycast versions, auto-generated context settings reverting to default, and failure to generate workstream summaries.  Check for updates for Pieces OS, the extension, and the OS itself. Ensure compatibility between versions and report issues with details for reproduction.
