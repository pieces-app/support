## Common Issues
### 1. Auto-Generated Context Resets to Medium
Users report that the Auto-Generated Context setting in the Pieces desktop app (macOS) repeatedly reverts to "Medium" from "High" after app restarts, OS updates, or periods of inactivity.  The behavior has persisted across multiple builds. It is unclear whether the "High" setting ever takes effect.
