## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Bugs: Selection Lock, High Resource Usage, Context Reset
Users report persistent selection lock, preventing normal interaction.  High RAM/CPU usage spikes also occur, potentially linked to internet connectivity.  Restarting Pieces OS is a temporary workaround.  Auto-generated context settings revert to "Medium" despite user changes.
