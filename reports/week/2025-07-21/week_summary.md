## Common Issues
### 1. Auto-Generated Context Resets to Medium
Users report that the Auto-Generated Context setting in the Pieces desktop app (macOS) repeatedly reverts to "Medium" from "High" after app restarts, OS updates, or periods of inactivity.  The behavior has persisted across multiple builds. It's unclear whether the "High" setting ever takes effect.

- Monitor the fix for the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting to ensure it resolves the issue permanently and doesn't reoccur in future updates.
- Consider adding a notification or confirmation message within the app when the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting is changed, to confirm the change has been saved and to inform users about any potential conflicts or automatic resets.
