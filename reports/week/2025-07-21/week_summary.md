## Common Issues
### 1. Auto-Generated Context Resets to Medium
Users report that the Auto-Generated Context setting in the Pieces desktop app (macOS) repeatedly reverts to "Medium" from "High" after app restarts, OS updates, or periods of inactivity.  The behavior has persisted across multiple builds. It's unclear whether the "High" setting ever takes effect.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the bug causing the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting to revert to 'Medium'. This appears to be the most frequent issue and source of support tickets.
- Improve communication with users regarding the 'Auto-Generated Context' setting.  Clarify its function and how it interacts with app restarts, OS updates, and periods of inactivity.
- Monitor the 'unable to reproduce' category.  If this category continues to grow, it may indicate a need for better tools or processes for reproducing and diagnosing user-reported issues.
