## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Bugs and Unexpected Behaviors
Users report issues with Pieces OS, including persistent selection mode, high RAM/CPU usage, and auto-generated context resetting to medium.  The selection bug involves unintended selection behavior, possibly related to shift/mouse1. High resource usage may be linked to internet connectivity.  The context setting issue involves the saved material enrichment option reverting to medium. Workarounds include restarting the application and manually readjusting settings.

### 2. PiecesOS Errors and Performance Issues
Users report issues with PiecesOS, including API errors when generating workstream summaries, high RAM/CPU usage, and LTM query failures after prolonged use.  A common error message points to a missing publisher model in Google Vertex AI.  Restarting PiecesOS is a temporary solution for high resource usage.  LTM issues may require clearing Pieces data, though the provided clear data feature may not function reliably.

- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time

### 3. PiecesOS macOS App Performance Issues
Users are experiencing performance issues with the Pieces macOS app, including slow LTM queries, failure to clear LTM data, and auto-generated context settings reverting to default.  Additionally, high RAM/CPU usage has been reported.  Restarting the app or clearing Pieces data may temporarily resolve some issues. Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and implement permanent solutions.

### 4. Pieces OS and extensions compatibility issues
Users are experiencing compatibility issues between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  Issues include Raycast extension incompatibility with newer Raycast versions and auto-generated context settings reverting to default.  Additionally, some users report failures generating workstream summaries.  Check for updates to both Pieces OS and related extensions. Ensure Pieces OS and extensions are compatible with the current operating system version.
