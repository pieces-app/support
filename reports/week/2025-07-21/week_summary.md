## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Bugs and Unexpected Behaviors
Users report issues with Pieces OS, including persistent selection mode, high RAM/CPU usage, and auto-generated context resetting to medium.  The selection bug involves unintended selection behavior, possibly related to shift/mouse click lock. High resource usage may be linked to internet connectivity.  The context setting issue involves the saved material enrichment option reverting to medium. Workarounds include restarting the application and manually adjusting settings.

### 2. PiecesOS Errors and Performance Degradation
Users report issues with PiecesOS, including high RAM/CPU usage, LTM query failures after prolonged use, and "Workstream Summary" generation errors.  A common error message points to a missing Publisher Model in Google Vertex AI.  Short-term solutions include restarting PiecesOS.  Clearing LTM data via the UI is reportedly ineffective. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and implement a permanent fix.

### 3. PiecesOS macOS App Performance Issues
Users are experiencing performance issues with the Pieces macOS app, including slow LTM queries, failure to clear LTM data, and auto-generated context settings reverting to default.  Additionally, high RAM and CPU usage have been reported. Restarting the app or clearing Pieces data may temporarily resolve some issues. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and implement a permanent fix.

### 4. Pieces OS and extensions compatibility issues
Users are experiencing compatibility issues between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  Issues include Raycast extension incompatibility with newer Raycast versions and auto-generated context settings reverting to default.  Additionally, some users report failures generating workstream summaries.  Check for updates to both Pieces and related extensions. Ensure Pieces settings are saving correctly.  If issues persist, contact Pieces support with detailed logs and reproduction steps.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and address the "Publisher Model not found" error impacting Workstream Summary generation and other features.
- Prioritize resolving the persistent selection mode bug in Pieces OS, as it significantly impacts usability.
- Investigate and fix the high RAM/CPU usage issue affecting both Windows and macOS users.
- Address the LTM query failures and data clearing issues on macOS.
- Ensure the auto-generated context settings are saving correctly across different platforms and after application restarts.
- Update the Raycast extension for compatibility with the latest Raycast versions.
