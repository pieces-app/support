## Common Issues
### 1. Auto-Generated Context Resets to Medium
Users report that the Auto-Generated Context setting in the desktop app (macOS) repeatedly reverts to "Medium" from "High" after app restarts, OS updates, or periods of inactivity.  The user is unsure if the "High" setting ever takes effect. This has persisted across multiple builds.
