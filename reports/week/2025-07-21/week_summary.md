## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Unexpected selection behavior and auto-generated context reset
Users reported persistent selection issues, possibly due to stuck "shift" or "mouse 1" keys, primarily on Windows. Additionally, the auto-generated context setting for saved material enrichment frequently resets to "Medium" on macOS, despite user changes.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and solutions for both issues.
