## Common Issues
### 1. Persistent Selection/Setting Issues in Pieces OS
Users report persistent, unintended selection behavior, possibly related to stuck "shift" or "mouse 1" keys on Windows.  Additionally, the Auto-Generated Context setting in Machine Learning consistently reverts to "Medium" on macOS despite user changes. Troubleshooting steps could include checking for conflicting software or system settings.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the persistent selection bug affecting Windows users. This appears to be a high-impact issue affecting usability.
- Address the issue with the Auto-Generated Context setting in Machine Learning reverting to "Medium" on macOS. While less frequent, it still impacts user experience.
- Prioritize bug fixes related to core functionality (selection, settings) to improve overall product stability.
- Consider improving error handling and messaging within the application. The "404 Publisher Model" error seen in issue descriptions is not user-friendly.
- Review support workflows and documentation. Ensure there are clear instructions for users to report issues and for support staff to troubleshoot them.
