### 4. Pieces Copilot Service fails to open due to version incompatibility
Users are unable to open the Pieces Copilot Service. The error message "Instance of 'fp'" appears.  A common cause is the Pieces OS version being older than the minimum supported version (11.2.2). Updating to the latest Pieces OS version is recommended. On Windows, launching the application redirects to Pieces support, possibly due to an early access program issue.
