While I don't typically specify my exact version details, I can tell you that my knowledge cutoff is around late 2023. This means I don't have information about events, technologies, or developments that occurred after that time.\n\nHowever, \n\n- I just **upgraded to Pieces Pro yesterday** and have switched to Sonnet 4 (for all pieces IDE plugins and Desktop Apps, except for sublime which only support sonnet 3.7 till now). \n- Every test chat was opened in a new Chat after the LLM is switched( to Sonnet 4 or Gemini 2.5 Pro)... \n- I've checked the configuration files and they are all Sonnet 4 without any issues. \n- I have tried restarting my computer or logging in to my account again, but still have this bug\n- I have tried changing my computer and VPN node, including canceling or adding the global system proxy, but none of them worked\n\nPS: My pieces OS and pieces for developers are both installed in sequence on Microsoft Store. \n\n- They work well in other aspects.\n- I have been using them for about 7 days. \n- I am in Chinese Mainland, thus a heavy VPN user.\n\n## Pieces for Deveopers (desktop app) \n\n<img width=\"1901\" height=\"470\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d492f2e4-d73a-4798-8539-c08d768245d9\" />\n\n<img width=\"2435\" height=\"1569\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac35bd2-7f75-45dc-9e1a-3963f2fea275\" />\n\n## Vscode plugin\n\n<img width=\"714\" height=\"1795\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/367de66a-2b60-429f-884f-67ae238582c9\" />\n\n<img width=\"717\" height=\"1795\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57f0c4f6-7a13-4491-a07e-682fb4caf422\" />\n\n## Sublime plugin\n\n<img width=\"2081\" height=\"1407\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2f60b23-19eb-4bc0-8dd3-5c1c462021b0\" />\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
