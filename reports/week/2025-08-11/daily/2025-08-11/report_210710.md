## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS LTM and Workstream Functionality Issues
Users are experiencing problems with the Pieces OS Long Term Memory (LTM) and Workstream features, primarily on macOS. Issues include LTM queries failing after extended use, Workstream activity not updating, and the "Clear LTM Data" button being unresponsive.  One user reported success after removing all Pieces data, suggesting potential performance issues with large datasets. Additionally, there are reports of the Pieces Copilot Service failing to open.

### 2. Pieces OS and plugins encounter various bugs
Users report issues with Pieces OS and its plugins across different operating systems (primarily Windows). These include: 1. Inability to drag files into conversation context. 2. File choosing window appearing behind other windows. 3. Filter rules not applying to all file types. 4. Pieces support opening by default on launch. 5. LLM not upgrading to the latest version despite user selection and configuration changes.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions.

### 3. Pieces OS 12.1.1 Bugs and Feature Requests
Users report issues with copying code blocks, dragging files into conversation context, and LLM not upgrading to the latest version (Sonnet 4) despite Pro subscription.  Copying inline code blocks and inter-line code blocks produces unexpected behavior.  Dragging files into conversation context fails.  LLM remains at Sonnet 3.5 in Pieces for Developers and VS Code plugin, and silent in Sublime, despite selecting Sonnet 4 in settings.  Users request partial copying for inline code blocks.

Browser extensions, even with VPN configurations, struggle to connect.  Temporary solutions include closing the desktop app or restarting Pieces OS.  Issues appear across Windows and involve Pieces OS versions 12.1.1 and 12.2.0, and Pieces for Developers 4.3.1.
