## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces connection and sharing failures on Windows
Users on Windows are experiencing issues connecting to the Pieces authentication site during installation (often bundled with UltraEdit) and when sharing snippets via links or GitHub gists.  VDI environments with security software like Cortex XDR may be blocking connections.  Check network connectivity and firewall settings.  Consider temporary disabling of security software for testing purposes. Ensure Pieces OS is up-to-date.
