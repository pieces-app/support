## Common Issues
### 1. LLM Upgrade Failure for Pieces Pro Users
Pieces Pro users on Windows 11 and MacOS are unable to upgrade their LLM to the latest version (Sonnet 4) despite selecting it in settings. The issue persists across Pieces for Developers, VS Code plugin, and Sublime plugin. Troubleshooting steps like restarting, re-login, changing network settings have been unsuccessful. Sublime plugin specifically reports using older Sonnet versions. Some users encounter errors related to Pieces Copilot or Settings Service.

### 2. Pieces Desktop App Causes Connection Leaks
Pieces Desktop app creates excessive connections to Pieces OS server, leading to connection leaks.  Temporary solutions include closing Pieces Desktop or restarting Pieces OS.  The Pieces for Developers and VS Code plugins may report incorrect LLM versions despite upgrades.  Users in China experience issues despite VPN and proxy adjustments.

- Prioritize resolution of issues related to Pieces Copilot and Settings Service, as these are critical components for user experience.
- Improve communication with users in China, ensuring VPN and proxy settings do not interfere with Pieces functionality.
- Investigate why incorrect LLM versions are being reported in Pieces for Developers and VS Code plugins despite upgrades.
