| [#747](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/747) | MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" despite functional LTM | 2.96 |

## Common Issues
### 1. ask_pieces_ltm tool consistently fails with "Failed to extract context"
Users report the `ask_pieces_ltm` MCP tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" error, despite a functional LTM and successful communication with the MCP server.  Other MCP tools like `create_pieces_memory` work correctly.  The issue persists across different clients and parameter variations.  Potential root causes include authentication/session issues, data access layer bugs, permissions problems, or initialization errors within the MCP server's interaction with the LTM data.

## Recommendations
- Investigate the root cause of the "Failed to extract context" error in the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool. This appears to be the most frequent issue and blocks access to long-term memory context.
- Review logs and code for the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool within the MCP server to understand the disconnect between the tool and the LTM data access layer.
- Verify authentication, permissions, and initialization procedures for the MCP server's access to LTM data, ensuring alignment with the main Pieces application's access.
- Consider adding more detailed error logging within the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool to provide better diagnostics for future debugging.
