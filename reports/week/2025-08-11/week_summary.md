## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS LTM and Workstream Functionality Issues
Users are experiencing problems with the Pieces OS Long Term Memory (LTM) and Workstream features, primarily on macOS.  The LTM fails to return results after extended use or stops recording new activities altogether.  Workstream updates may also be affected.  Clearing LTM data is ineffective, and the issue recurs.  Potential solutions include optimizing LTM performance, improving data clearing functionality, and investigating compatibility issues with macOS versions.

### 2. Pieces OS and plugins encounter various bugs
Users report issues with Pieces OS and its plugins across different operating systems (primarily Windows). These include: inability to drag files into conversation context, file choosing window issues, filtering problems, automatic redirection to support, and LLM upgrade failures.

Despite upgrading to Pieces Pro and selecting Sonnet 4, the LLM remains on Sonnet 3.5 in Pieces for Developers and VS Code plugin. Additional feature request for partial copying of inline code blocks.
