The only explanation I can come up with is that it's just getting too big. The Workstream is, however, updating fine.\n\nRemoving all my Pieces data gets the LTM working again, but then I end up with this situation later. This is the third time I've been through this loop. It's really frustrating, because when I actually need the LTM, it fails.\n\nThe Clear LTM Data button doesn't work, just returning to Try again, from All Data to even for just clearing an hour of data.\n\nI haven't cleared the LTM (well, I've tried, but the Clear LTM Data button doesn't work) so we have a live broken environment to debug with. I'm more than happy to assist with debugging this - let me know what you need!\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

Verify MCP Server is Running\n```bash\nlsof -i :39300\n# Shows Pieces OS listening on port 39300 with multiple established connections\n```\n\n### 2. Confirm Tools are Available\n```bash\ncurl -N http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse \\\n  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' &\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tools/list\"}'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 Successfully returns tools list with `ask_pieces_ltm` tool schema\n\n### 3. Test create_pieces_memory (Working)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"create_pieces_memory\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"summary\":\"Test memory\",\n        \"summary_description\":\"Testing connection\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 `\"Long term memory successfully created\"`\n\n### 4. Test ask_pieces_ltm (Failing)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":3,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"ask_pieces_ltm\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"question\":\"What did I work on today?\",\n        \"chat_llm\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u274c `{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Failed to extract context\"}],\"isError\":true}`\n\n## Attempted Variations (All Failed)\n\n### Minimal Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"hello\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n}\n```\n\n### With Application Sources\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What terminal commands have I run recently?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\"],\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\"\n}\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What did I work on today?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\", \"Google Chrome\"],\n  \"topics\": [\"terminal\", \"commands\", \"recent\"],\n  \"related_questions\": [\"What was I working on?\", \"What debugging was I doing?\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Different Application Sources Tested\n- `[\"Warp\"]`\n- `[\"Google Chrome\", \"Safari\", \"Obsidian\"]`\n- `[\"Claude\"]`\n- Multiple combinations from the schema list\n\n**All variations return the same error.**\n\n## Troubleshooting Attempted\n\n1. \u2705 **Restarted Pieces MCP server** - Issue persists\n2. \u2705 **Verified Pieces OS permissions** - Has necessary macOS permissions\n3. \u2705 **Confirmed LTM data collection** - User sees active workstream data\n4. \u2705 **Tested different MCP clients** - Same error in Warp Agent Mode, Claude, and direct curl\n5. \u2705 **Used proper SSE endpoint** - `/sse` for responses, `/messages` for requests\n6. \u2705 **Verified JSON-RPC format** - Matches working `create_pieces_memory` calls\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `ask_pieces_ltm` tool should return contextual information from the user's LTM data, similar to how the main Pieces application shows workstream summaries and context.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nEvery call to `ask_pieces_ltm` returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Failed to extract context\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis appears to be an **MCP server implementation issue** where:\n\n1. The `ask_pieces_ltm` tool is properly registered and callable\n2. The MCP communication protocol works correctly\n3. The underlying LTM system has data and functions properly\n4. There's a disconnect between the MCP tool implementation and the LTM data access layer\n\n## Potential Root Causes\n\n1. **Authentication/Session Issue**: MCP server process may lack proper authentication to access LTM data\n2. **Data Access Layer Bug**: `ask_pieces_ltm` implementation may be using incorrect API calls to access LTM\n3. **Permissions Issue**: MCP server may not have the same data access permissions as the main Pieces application\n4. **Initialization Problem**: LTM access for MCP tools may require additional setup or initialization\n\n## Request\n\nPlease investigate the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation in the Pieces MCP server to identify why it cannot access the same LTM data that is clearly available to the main Pieces application.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Issue occurs consistently across different MCP clients (Warp, Claude)\n- `create_pieces_memory` works perfectly, confirming MCP communication\n- LTM is actively collecting and displaying data in the main Pieces app\n- No relevant error logs found in system logs or Pieces application logs\n- Multiple parameter variations attempted with identical results\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

While the SSE endpoint responds initially, it hangs indefinitely, preventing MCP tools from being registered or used. This affects Claude Code integration both as a standalone CLI and when used within VS Code.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Install Pieces OS and Pieces app\n2. Login in the app\n3.

Snippet below. I had issues with it stopping suddenly. With help of vscode github copilot we determined that it was connections were used up. Investigation yielded that when Pieces Desktop not running only two connections present. When I started Pieces Desktop connections jumped to 50.  Below the MCP config snippet is copy of github copilot working session.\n\n\"pieces\": {\n\t\"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\",\n\t\"type\": \"http\",\n\t\"gallery\": true,\n\t\"autoStart\": false,\n\t\"timeout\": 30000,\n\t\"retryDelay\": 5000,\n\t\"maxRetries\": 3\n}\n\nI have started pieces desktop app. I informed it of our changes which it concurs. Can you check connection status and health of pieces now that I have stared pieces desktop?\n\nI'll check the connection status and health of the Pieces MCP server now that you've started the Pieces desktop app.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The connection leak problem is back! Let me check which processes are involved:\n\nProblem Identified! \ud83d\udea8\nThe issue is that starting the Pieces Desktop app (pieces_for_x.exe) has re-created the connection leak problem:\n\nProcess 35956: os_server.exe (Pieces OS) - listening on port 39300\nProcess 29660: Code.exe (VS Code) - 1 connection (good)\nProcess 37316: pieces_for_x.exe (Pieces Desktop) - 50+ connections (bad!)\n\nThe Root Cause:\nThe Pieces Desktop application itself has a connection leak bug - it's creating excessive connections to the Pieces OS server, just like we saw before with VS Code.\n\nSolutions:\nOption 1: Temporary Fix (Close Pieces Desktop)\nOption 2: Keep Pieces Desktop but Monitor\nIf you need the Pieces Desktop app running, you can:\n\nMonitor connections periodically\nRestart Pieces OS periodically to clear leaks\nReport this as a bug to Pieces support\nLet's check if closing the desktop app fixed the connections:\n\nPerfect! Now let's test the MCP connection:\n\npieces (MCP Server)\nConnection Status: \u2705 HEALTHY!\nPerfect! The Pieces MCP server is now working correctly with excellent connection health:\n\nCurrent Status:\n\u2705 2 established connections (down from 50+)\n\u2705 MCP server responding successfully\n\u2705 Clean connection state with minimal overhead\n\u2705 No connection leaks\nRoot Cause Confirmed:\nThe issue was specifically with the Pieces Desktop application (pieces_for_x.exe) creating excessive connections. The Pieces OS (os_server.exe) and VS Code MCP integration work fine together.\n\nCurrent Working Configuration:\nPieces OS: Running and healthy\nVS Code MCP: Connected with proper timeout settings\nPieces Desktop: Stopped (to prevent connection leaks)\nToday's Work Context Retrieved:\nFrom the MCP response, I can see you're actively working on:\n\nDatabase Mapping Projects:\n\nGWM-22316: Map database tables to GWMS UI elements\nGWM-22318: Customer SVP database migration\nCustomer and facility screen analysis\nDevelopment Tools:\n\nVS Code with MCP integration\nOracle SQL Developer for database work\nTime tracking with Toggl and Clockk\nRecent Focus Areas:\n\nVite platform work\nKeycloak maintenance\nResearch flow documentation with LLMs\nRecommendation:\nKeep the current setup as-is:\n\n\u2705 Use Pieces OS for the MCP integration (working perfectly)\n\u26a0\ufe0f Avoid Pieces Desktop until they fix the connection leak bug\n\u2705 Monitor connections occasionally with netstat if needed\nThe MCP integration is now stable and providing excellent work context tracking without the connection leak issues!\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
