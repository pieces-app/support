Issues include LTM queries taking too long or returning nothing, Workstream not updating, and inability to open Pieces Core Services.  Some users report success after clearing Pieces data, but the issue reoccurs.  A potential cause is the LTM becoming too large.  The \"Clear LTM Data\" button is also reported as not functioning.",

The only explanation I can come up with is that it's just getting too big. The Workstream is, however, updating fine.\n\nRemoving all my Pieces data gets the LTM working again, but then I end up with this situation later. This is the third time I've been through this loop. It's really frustrating, because when I actually need the LTM, it fails.\n\nThe Clear LTM Data button doesn't work, just returning to Try again, from All Data to even for just clearing an hour of data.\n\nI haven't cleared the LTM (well, I've tried, but the Clear LTM Data button doesn't work) so we have a live broken environment to debug with. I'm more than happy to assist with debugging this - let me know what you need!\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
