## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the LLM upgrade issue for Pro users. This appears to be the most frequent and active issue across multiple platforms (desktop application, VS Code, Sublime plugin).
- Investigate network connectivity issues, especially for users in regions with restricted internet access. The user report mentions heavy VPN usage, which could be contributing to the problem.
- Improve communication about LLM versions within the Pieces suite. Ensure consistent reporting across all plugins and the desktop app. The Sublime plugin, for example, doesn't seem to provide clear version information.
- Review and update the Pro upgrade process to ensure seamless LLM version switching. The user reported issues despite selecting Sonnet 4 in settings.
