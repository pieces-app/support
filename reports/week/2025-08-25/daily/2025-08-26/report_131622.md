## Common Issues
### 1. Users unable to sign in to Pieces OS across platforms
Multiple users report issues signing into Pieces OS on desktop and VS Code extension.  Symptoms include continuous installation requests for the VS Code extension, authentication loops, and 500 internal server errors.  Browser extensions seem less affected.  Logs reveal issues with the /os/sign_in endpoint.  Pro users also report not accessing pro features despite being logged in.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the sign-in issue affecting Pieces OS across platforms (especially Desktop and VS Code extension).  This appears to be the most common and impactful issue based on user reports and error logs pointing to the `/os/sign_in` endpoint.
- Investigate the issue with Pro users not accessing Pro features despite being logged in. This might be related to the broader authentication problems.
- Improve the VS Code extension installation process. The continuous installation requests suggest a significant usability problem.
- Monitor and address the reported 500 internal server errors. These errors likely contribute to the authentication and Pro feature access issues.
- Review logs and user reports for the Pieces side bar issues to identify the root cause and implement a fix.
- Consider adding more detailed logging around the authentication flow to aid in debugging and future issue identification.
