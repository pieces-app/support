When I click the \"Sign In\" button, my browser opens and then immediately redirects me to an authentication-error page. This creates an infinite loop, preventing me from accessing the application.\n\nThe log files indicate that a 500 Internal Server Error is occurring when the application makes a POST request to the /os/sign_in endpoint.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\nOpen the Pieces OS application.\n\nClick on the \"Sign In\" button.\n\nThe browser opens to the authentication page.\n\nIt immediately fails and redirects to the error URL: https://pieces.app/authentication-error?sentry_id=...\n\nExpected Behavior\nI expect to be successfully authenticated and logged into the Pieces OS application.\n\nActual Behavior\nAn infinite authentication loop occurs, and I cannot log in. The application logs show a clear HTTP 500 error during the sign-in attempt.\n\nSystem Information\nOS: Windows\n\nPieces OS Version: 12.2.1 (from logs)\n\nLogs\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.991449  Starting OS_Server!\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.992444  Starting EnvConf\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.992444  Starting DeploymentInfo\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  Number: 267\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  Tag: 12.2.1\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  Branch: 12.2.1\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  SHA1: f1676119a37cc2cf3af498efbe5b4c00bbf97ff9\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  WinDeployType: exe\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  Channel : production\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.993445  Process ID: 6180\n[D]  Setting Url Protocol Scheme for Inno Setup/ Squirrel Installs\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:42.995471  Logging to file: C:\\Users\\Pouya Sadeghpoor\\AppData\\Local\\Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc\\Pieces OS\\com.pieces.os\\production\\Support/logs/log-08252025.txt\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.007794  Copying the vocab file to the data directory\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.009009  Successfully copied the vocab file\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.009009  Starting OS\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.014005  Starting OS\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.016592  Starting UI\n[D]  No valid data or identity found in either location\n[D]  getData: New user, using cache directory directly\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.019417  UI#builder, hasData: false, hasError: false\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.019417  stateStream#onListen\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.019417  OS#boot - Starting boot process\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.019417  OS#attach\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.019417  OS#boot - attach() completed in 0ms\n\u001b[38;5;12m[I]\u001b[0m  initializeDataSingletons - Starting data singletons initialization\n\u001b[38;5;12m[I]\u001b[0m  initializeDataSingletons - Logger initialization completed in 0ms\n[D]  No valid data or identity found in either location\n[D]  getData: New user, using cache directory directly\n[D]  No valid data or identity found in either location\n[D]  getData: New user, using cache directory directly\n[D]  No valid data or identity found in either location\n[D]  getData: New user, using cache directory directly\n[D]  No valid data or identity found in either location\n[D]  getData: New user, using cache directory directly\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.121165  Created our Tagify Files Locally.\n[D]  2025-08-25T18:21:43.121165  User added tagify files now exist.\n\u001b[38;5;12m[I]\u001b[0m  (pieces_app_vector_search_couchbase_lite_executable) Exit code on execution step: 0\n\u001b[38;5;12m[I]\u001b[0m  (pieces_app_vector_search_couchbase_lite_executable) Stdout on execution step: Dynamic libraries path: C:\\Program Files\\Pieces OS\n\n\n\nSystem temp directory path: C:\\Users\\POUYAS~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\n\n\n\nNew unique temp directory path: C:\\Users\\POUYAS~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\98b7b31\n\n\n\n\n\u001b[38;5;12m[I]\u001b[0m  (pieces_app_vector_search_couchbase_lite_executable) Stderr on execution step: 2025-08-25T18:21:43.212379 DB warning Database.log.file.config is null, meaning file logging is disabled.
