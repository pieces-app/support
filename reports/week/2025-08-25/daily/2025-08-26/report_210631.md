Issues include continuous installation requests for the VS Code extension, inability to log in, and failure to connect even with VPN configurations.

Problems include Obsidian extension not detecting the Pieces port, browser extensions failing to connect even with VPN configurations, and sidebar login/pro feature issues.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed from 1000 to 39300), firewall/VPN settings, and ensure Pieces OS and extensions are on the same network and logged into the same account.
