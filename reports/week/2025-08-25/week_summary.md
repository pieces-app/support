## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop App Display Issues
Users report difficulties viewing large markdown responses in the Pieces Copilot on the Windows desktop application.  Scrolling is impaired due to oversized content.  Additionally, some users experience issues with code block collapsing and sidebar functionality. Troubleshooting steps include checking Pieces OS version and ensuring it's up-to-date.

### 2. Pieces connectivity and login issues across platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (VS Code, Chrome, Edge) to the Pieces OS.  Issues include continuous installation requests for the VS Code extension, inability to log in, and failure to connect even with VPN configurations.  Additionally, some users report Pro features not activating despite upgrading.  Troubleshooting steps include reinstalling dependencies, checking VPN settings, and ensuring the Pieces OS is running.

### 3. Pieces OS connection issues across multiple platforms
Users are reporting difficulties connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (Obsidian, Chrome, Edge) to Pieces OS.  Problems include undetected ports, failed logins, and pro features not activating. This affects Windows users, some using VPNs.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed to 39300), and ensure the Pieces desktop app is running and connected.

### 4. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users report issues with the Pieces desktop application, including unintended selection behavior (potentially related to stuck shift/mouse click), inability to collapse code blocks, and sidebar issues such as error logs not saving and pro settings not applying despite being logged in.  These issues span different Pieces OS versions (12.2.1, 12.2.2) and Desktop versions (4.3.1, 4.3.4).

**Related Issues:**
- [#803](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/803): it doesnt stop selecting, it seems like "shift" or "mouse 1" is locked

### 5. Pieces OS and Desktop App Issues
Users are experiencing problems with backup restoration, core dependencies, and the Pieces sidebar. Backup restoration fails to complete, core dependencies encounter retry step errors, and the sidebar has display issues and pro setting access problems.  Check logs, reinstall, and ensure Pieces OS and app versions are compatible.

**Related Issues:**
- [#837](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/837): backup restoration fails

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving connectivity issues between Pieces OS and extensions/plugins (VS Code, Obsidian, Chrome, Edge). Focus on port detection, login failures, and Pro feature activation.
- Investigate and address the Pieces Desktop application issues: unintended selection behavior, code block collapsing, and sidebar problems (error logs, Pro settings).
- Improve the Pieces Copilot experience by fixing markdown display issues (scrolling, oversized content) and code block collapsing functionality.
- Address Pieces OS core dependency errors during installation and backup restoration failures.
- Look into reports of high RAM/CPU usage by Pieces OS and authentication loop/500 errors during sign-in.
