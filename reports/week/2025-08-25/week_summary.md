## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces connectivity and login issues across platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (VS Code, Chrome, Edge) to the Pieces OS.  Issues include continuous installation requests for the VS Code extension, inability to log in, and failure to connect even with VPN configurations.  Additionally, some users report Pro features not activating despite upgrading and logging in.  Troubleshooting steps include reinstalling dependencies, checking VPN settings, and verifying login status.

### 2. Pieces OS and Desktop App Issues
Users are experiencing issues with Pieces OS and the Desktop App, including backup restoration failures, dependency errors during setup, and sidebar display problems.  Backup restore processes stall.  The "Ensure core dependencies" step fails.  The Pieces sidebar has display issues and pro features are unavailable despite an upgraded account.  Check logs for error details and ensure Pieces OS and app versions are up-to-date.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs and UI Issues
Users report issues with the Pieces desktop application on Windows, including unintended selection behavior (potentially related to shift/mouse click lock), inability to collapse code blocks, and sidebar issues such as error logs not saving and pro settings not applying despite being logged in.  The reported Pieces OS versions range from 12.2.1 to 12.2.2, and the desktop application version is 4.3.1 or 4.3.4.  Further investigation is needed to determine the root causes and solutions.

### 4. Pieces Desktop App Issues
Users report issues with the Pieces desktop app, primarily on Windows, including large markdown blocks in Copilot responses making scrolling difficult, inability to collapse code blocks, and problems with the Pieces sidebar.  Some users also report issues with the upgrade process and Pro settings not applying. Troubleshooting steps include checking for updates, reinstalling the app, and verifying login status.

### 5. Pieces OS connection issues across multiple platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (Obsidian, Chrome, Edge) to Pieces OS.  Problems include undetected ports, failed logins, and pro features not activating. This affects Windows users, some using VPNs.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed to 39300), and ensure the Pieces desktop app is running.

**Related Issues:**
- [#841](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/841): Pieces extension for Obsidian using port 1000 but Pieces OS now listening port 39300

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving connectivity issues between Pieces OS and extensions/plugins (VS Code, Chrome, Edge, Obsidian).  This appears to be a recurring and widespread problem impacting users across multiple platforms.
- Investigate and address the issues with the Pieces sidebar, including display problems, error log saving failures, and Pro settings not applying. These issues contribute to a negative user experience.
- Focus on resolving issues related to Pieces OS and the Desktop App, such as backup restoration failures, dependency errors during setup, and unintended selection behavior. These core functionalities are crucial for user workflow.
- Address the large markdown blocks in Copilot responses affecting scrolling and the inability to collapse code blocks within the desktop application. These UI/UX issues hinder usability.
- Look into reports of Pieces OS high RAM/CPU usage (Issue #150) and authentication flow errors (Issue #769) as these impact performance and access.
