## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces connectivity and installation issues across platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty installing and connecting Pieces extensions and applications, primarily on Windows. Issues include the VS Code extension failing to install or load, browser extensions (Chrome, Edge) unable to connect to Pieces OS, and the Pieces sidebar not saving error logs or reflecting Pro account upgrades.  Connectivity problems may be related to VPN usage. Further investigation into installation processes and network configurations is needed.

### 2. Pieces OS and Desktop App Issues
Users are experiencing problems with Pieces OS and the Desktop App, including backup restoration failures, issues with the "Ensure core dependencies" step during installation, and problems with the Pieces sidebar.  The backup restoration process gets stuck, and the "Ensure core dependencies" step prompts users to retry.  Additionally, users are encountering login and pro version access issues with the sidebar despite being logged in. More investigation is needed to determine the root causes and solutions.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs and Issues
Users are experiencing various issues with the Pieces desktop application, including selection problems (stuck shift/mouse click), inability to collapse code blocks, and sidebar issues (saving errors, pro settings not applying). These problems occur across different Pieces OS versions (12.2.1, 12.2.2) and Desktop versions (4.3.1, 4.3.4). Some users have reported temporary workarounds like switching back to older OS versions, but no permanent solutions have been identified yet.

### 4. Pieces Desktop App Display Issues
Users report display issues with large markdown blocks in Copilot responses, preventing scrolling.  Additionally, some experience problems with code block collapsing and sidebar functionality.  Issues appear across Windows OS and Pieces OS versions 12.2.1 and 12.2.2. Further investigation into rendering and UI elements is needed.

### 5. Pieces OS connection issues across multiple platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (Obsidian, Chrome, Edge) to Pieces OS.  Problems include undetected ports, failed logins, and pro features not activating. This affects Windows users, some using VPNs.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed to 39300), ensure login credentials are correct, and verify VPN/firewall configurations.

**Related Issues:**
