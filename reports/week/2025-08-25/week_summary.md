## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving connectivity issues between Pieces OS and extensions/plugins (VS Code, Chrome, Edge, Obsidian).  This appears to be the most common problem area.
- Investigate and address the reported UI/UX issues with the Pieces desktop application, particularly on Windows (oversized markdown responses, code block collapse, sidebar issues, unintended selection behavior).
- Improve the update mechanism for the Pieces desktop app on macOS to prevent infinite loops.
- Review and clarify the email address management system to ensure proper handling of GitHub account changes and newsletter subscriptions.
- Investigate high RAM/CPU usage reported in ticket #150.
- Address the authentication loop and 500 internal server errors reported in ticket #845.
- Look into the issue of Pro features not activating despite users being logged in.
