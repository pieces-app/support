## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces connectivity and login issues across platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (VS Code, Chrome, Edge) to the Pieces OS.  Issues include continuous installation requests for the VS Code extension, inability to log in, and failure to connect even with VPN configurations.  Additionally, some users report Pro features not activating despite upgrading and logging in.  Troubleshooting steps include reinstalling dependencies, checking VPN settings, and verifying login status.

### 2. Pieces Desktop App Issues
Users report issues with the Pieces desktop app, including large markdown blocks in Copilot responses making scrolling difficult, inability to collapse code blocks, and problems with the Pieces sidebar.  Additionally, some users are experiencing issues with Pro settings not applying despite being logged in. Troubleshooting steps may include checking for updates, reinstalling the app, and ensuring account synchronization.

Backup restoration fails midway, dependency installation gets stuck on "Retry Step", and the sidebar has display issues.  Additionally, some Pro users are unable to access their upgraded features despite being logged in.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root causes and provide solutions.

Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (Obsidian, Chrome, Edge) to Pieces OS.  Problems include undetected ports, failed logins, and pro features not activating. This affects Windows users, some using VPNs.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed to 39300), and ensure the Pieces desktop app is running.

- Investigate and fix issues with the Pieces desktop application, including the oversized markdown blocks in Copilot responses, code block collapsing, sidebar display problems, and unintended selection behavior.
- Address problems with Pieces OS and desktop application core functionalities, such as backup restoration failures, dependency installation issues ("Retry Step"), and Pro settings not applying.
- Improve communication with users regarding the change in default port to 39300 and provide clear troubleshooting steps for connection problems.
