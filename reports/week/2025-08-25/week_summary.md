## Recommendations

- Investigate and address the issues with the Pieces desktop app, particularly on Windows (sidebar problems, unintended selection behavior, code block collapse).
- Improve the update process for the Pieces desktop app on macOS to prevent the infinite update loop.
- Address the issue of Pro features not activating despite users being logged in.
- Look into the large markdown blocks in Copilot responses on Windows and improve scrolling/display.
- Review and refine the Pieces OS port detection and configuration process for extensions/plugins to ensure smooth connections.
- Investigate and resolve the reported RAM/CPU usage spikes in Pieces OS.
