## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces connectivity and installation issues across platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty installing and connecting Pieces extensions and applications, primarily on Windows. Issues include the VS Code extension failing to install or load, browser extensions (Chrome, Edge) unable to connect to Pieces OS, and the Pieces sidebar not saving error logs or reflecting Pro account upgrades.  Connectivity problems may be related to VPN usage.  Users have tried reinstalling dependencies and restarting applications without success.

### 2. Pieces OS and Desktop App Issues
Users are experiencing problems with backup restoration, core dependencies, and the sidebar. Backup restoration fails midway, core dependencies get stuck on "Retry Step", and the sidebar has display issues and pro account features are unavailable despite being logged in.  Check logs for errors, reinstall/update the app, and ensure account sync.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users are experiencing various issues with the Pieces desktop application, including unintended selection behavior (potentially related to stuck shift/mouse click), inability to collapse code blocks, and sidebar issues such as error logs not saving and pro settings not applying despite being logged in.  These issues appear across different Pieces OS versions (12.2.1, 12.2.2) and Desktop versions (4.3.1, 4.3.4).

**Related Issues:**

### 4. Pieces Desktop App Issues
Users report issues with the Pieces desktop app, primarily on Windows, including large markdown blocks in Copilot responses making scrolling difficult, inability to collapse code blocks, and problems with the Pieces sidebar.  Some users experience issues with the upgrade process and Pro settings not applying despite being logged in. Troubleshooting steps include checking for updates, reinstalling the app, and ensuring account synchronization.

**Related Issues:**

### 5. Pieces OS connection issues across multiple platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (Obsidian, Chrome, Edge) to Pieces OS.  Problems include undetected ports, failed logins, and pro features not activating. This affects Windows users, some using VPNs.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed to 39300), ensure login credentials are correct, and verify VPN/firewall configurations.

**Related Issues:**
- [#841](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/841): Pieces extension for Obsidian using port 1000 but Pieces OS now listening port 39300

- Review backup restoration failures (#837) and core dependency issues (#809) impacting initial setup and app functionality.
- Improve communication about Pieces OS port changes (from 1000 to 39300) to minimize user confusion and connection problems.
- Investigate and resolve the issue with Pro account features not applying despite users being logged in (#843, #819) to ensure Pro users receive the expected benefits.
