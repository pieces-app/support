## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and Desktop App Issues
Users are experiencing problems with backup restoration, dependency installation, and sidebar functionality in the Pieces OS desktop and web applications across Windows and Linux. Backup restoration fails midway, the "Ensure core dependencies" step gets stuck, and the sidebar malfunctions with login and pro version access.  Logs aren't saving. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root causes and solutions.

Users are experiencing difficulty connecting Pieces extensions and plugins (VS Code, Chrome, Edge) to the Pieces OS.  Issues include continuous installation requests for the VS Code extension, inability to log in, and failure to connect even with VPN configurations.  Additionally, some users report Pro features not activating despite upgrading.  Troubleshooting steps include reinstalling dependencies, checking VPN settings, and ensuring the Pieces OS is running.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs and UI Issues
Users report issues with the Pieces desktop application on Windows, including unintended selection behavior (potentially related to stuck shift/mouse click), inability to collapse code blocks, and sidebar issues such as error logs not saving and pro settings not applying despite being logged in.  The reported Pieces OS versions range from 12.2.1 to 12.2.2, and the desktop application version is 4.3.1 or 4.3.4.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions.

Users report issues with the Pieces desktop app, primarily on Windows, including large markdown blocks in Copilot responses making scrolling difficult, inability to collapse code blocks, and problems with the Pieces sidebar.  Additionally, some users experience issues with Pro settings not applying despite being logged in. Troubleshooting steps include checking for Pieces OS updates and ensuring the app and OS versions are compatible.

Users are reporting difficulties connecting Pieces extensions (Obsidian, Chrome, Edge) to Pieces OS. Problems include Obsidian extension failing to send highlighted text, browser extensions unable to connect even with VPN configurations, and sidebar login/pro features not working.  Check Pieces OS version, port settings (default changed to 39300), firewall/VPN settings, and ensure Pieces OS and extensions are on the same network and logged into the same account.

- Investigate and address Pieces OS and extension connectivity problems, focusing on port settings, VPN configurations, and consistent login states.
- Troubleshoot Pieces Desktop application bugs on Windows, including unintended selection behavior, code block collapsing, and Copilot response formatting.
- Address backup restoration failures, dependency installation issues, and ensure logs are saving correctly in Pieces OS and Desktop app.
- Improve communication regarding Pro feature activation and ensure users have access after upgrading.
