The user, an IT professional, has experienced persistent attacks requiring frequent factory restores over the past four years.  They've shared a Warp Bot report and suspect a compromised kernel despite restores.  They request Pieces OS be excluded as a potential source of the suspicious connections.",

I\u2019ve reported the issues to Apple using Warp Bot reports, but the device detects \u201csuspicious connections.\u201d I\u2019d like to exclude your software since it\u2019s beneficial for developers, but the attacks are persistent.\n\nI\u2019ve included Warp Bot\u2019s findings and sent them to Apple\u2019s security team. \n\nThe bot has also prepared a report for the suspicious connections utilizing your software\n\n[PIECES_OS_GITHUB_ISSUE_PUBLIC.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22247971/PIECES_OS_GITHUB_ISSUE_PUBLIC.md)\n\nI should mention the kernel on my machine is compromised and this is after a factory restore and wiping of the hard drives. It's an ongoing issue, but wanted to alert you as best I could\n\n. I suspect attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the past, leading to frequent factory restores every two to three months for the past four years. As an IT professional, I know what to look for, but these attacks have made me rethink my defenses. Despite this, I\u2019m doing my best to protect my home network from such attacks.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
