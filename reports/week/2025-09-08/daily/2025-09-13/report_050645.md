- Investigate the Pieces OS service startup process for potential conflicts or errors, particularly on Windows 11.
- Provide clear instructions or a troubleshooter for users experiencing the startup issue, including steps to safely clear Pieces data/config files if necessary.
- Gather more data on the affected user base, including OS versions and Pieces Desktop versions, to determine the full scope of the issue.
- Improve communication with affected users, acknowledging the issue and providing updates on progress towards a resolution.
- Consider adding a warning or check during the Pieces OS update process to prevent installations that might lead to startup failures.
- Review logs and error messages related to the "Ensure Core Dependencies" step in Pieces Desktop to pinpoint the root cause of the startup failure.
- Investigate the reported issue on MacOS where users are unable to open the Pieces Settings Service.
- Analyze the support logs provided by users to identify patterns and potential solutions for both Windows and MacOS issues.
