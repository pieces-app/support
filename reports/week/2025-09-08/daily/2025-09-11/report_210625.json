While the SSE endpoint responds initially, it hangs indefinitely, preventing MCP tools from being registered or used. This affects Claude Code integration both as a standalone CLI and when used within VS Code.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Install Pieces OS and Pieces app\n2. Login in the app\n3. Configure MCP in Claude Code's ~/.claude.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pieces\": {\n    \"type\": \"sse\",\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\"\n}\n```\n\n4. Attempt to use Pieces MCP tools (e.g., mcp__pieces__ask_pieces_ltm) in Claude Code\n5. Tools are not available despite server being configured\n6. Same issue occurs whether using Claude Code in terminal or integrated with VS Code\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- SSE endpoint (http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse) responds with:\n\n```\nevent: endpoint\ndata: /model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages\n```\n\n- Connection then hangs indefinitely (SSE buffering issue)\n- Both Pieces OS and Pieces app processes are running\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate the root cause of the MCP SSE connection issue described in issue #810. This appears to be the primary support issue at the moment and is affecting macOS users with Pieces OS 12.1.1.  Focus on the SSE buffering problem on the endpoint `http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse`.",
    "Once the MCP SSE connection issue is resolved, release a fix and update the support documentation and release notes.  Ensure users are aware of the fix and how to update.",
    "Monitor the incoming support tickets for any recurring issues or trends. This will help identify and address any systemic problems proactively."
