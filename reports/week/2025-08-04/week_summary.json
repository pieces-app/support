While the SSE endpoint responds initially, it hangs indefinitely, preventing MCP tools from being registered or used. This affects Claude Code integration both as a standalone CLI and when used within VS Code.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Install Pieces OS and Pieces app\n2. Login in the app\n3. Configure MCP in Claude Code's ~/.claude.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pieces\": {\n    \"type\": \"sse\",\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\"\n}\n```\n\n4. Attempt to use Pieces MCP tools (e.g., mcp__pieces__ask_pieces_ltm) in Claude Code\n5. Tools are not available despite server being configured\n6. Same issue occurs whether using Claude Code in terminal or integrated with VS Code\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- SSE endpoint (http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse) responds with:\n\n```\nevent: endpoint\ndata: /model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages\n```\n\n- Connection then hangs indefinitely (SSE buffering issue)\n- Both Pieces OS and Pieces app processes are running\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

Snippet below. I had issues with it stopping suddenly. With help of vscode github copilot we determined that it was connections were used up. Investigation yielded that when Pieces Desktop not running only two connections present. When I started Pieces Desktop connections jumped to 50.  Below the MCP config snippet is copy of github copilot working session.\n\n\"pieces\": {\n\t\"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\",\n\t\"type\": \"http\",\n\t\"gallery\": true,\n\t\"autoStart\": false,\n\t\"timeout\": 30000,\n\t\"retryDelay\": 5000,\n\t\"maxRetries\": 3\n}\n\nI have started pieces desktop app. I informed it of our changes which it concurs. Can you check connection status and health of pieces now that I have stared pieces desktop?\n\nI'll check the connection status and health of the Pieces MCP server now that you've started the Pieces desktop app.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The connection leak problem is back! Let me check which processes are involved:\n\nProblem Identified! \ud83d\udea8\nThe issue is that starting the Pieces Desktop app (pieces_for_x.exe) has re-created the connection leak problem:\n\nProcess 35956: os_server.exe (Pieces OS) - listening on port 39300\nProcess 29660: Code.exe (VS Code) - 1 connection (good)\nProcess 37316: pieces_for_x.exe (Pieces Desktop) - 50+ connections (bad!)\n\nThe Root Cause:\nThe Pieces Desktop application itself has a connection leak bug - it's creating excessive connections to the Pieces OS server, just like we saw before with VS Code.\n\nSolutions:\nOption 1: Temporary Fix (Close Pieces Desktop)\nOption 2: Keep Pieces Desktop but Monitor\nIf you need the Pieces Desktop app running, you can:\n\nMonitor connections periodically\nRestart Pieces OS periodically to clear leaks\nReport this as a bug to Pieces support\nLet's check if closing the desktop app fixed the connections:\n\nPerfect! Now let's test the MCP connection:\n\npieces (MCP Server)\nConnection Status: \u2705 HEALTHY!\nPerfect! The Pieces MCP server is now working correctly with excellent connection health:\n\nCurrent Status:\n\u2705 2 established connections (down from 50+)\n\u2705 MCP server responding successfully\n\u2705 Clean connection state with minimal overhead\n\u2705 No connection leaks\nRoot Cause Confirmed:\nThe issue was specifically with the Pieces Desktop application (pieces_for_x.exe) creating excessive connections. The Pieces OS (os_server.exe) and VS Code MCP integration work fine together.\n\nCurrent Working Configuration:\nPieces OS: Running and healthy\nVS Code MCP: Connected with proper timeout settings\nPieces Desktop: Stopped (to prevent connection leaks)\nToday's Work Context Retrieved:\nFrom the MCP response, I can see you're actively working on:\n\nDatabase Mapping Projects:\n\nGWM-22316: Map database tables to GWMS UI elements\nGWM-22318: Customer SVP database migration\nCustomer and facility screen analysis\nDevelopment Tools:\n\nVS Code with MCP integration\nOracle SQL Developer for database work\nTime tracking with Toggl and Clockk\nRecent Focus Areas:\n\nVite platform work\nKeycloak maintenance\nResearch flow documentation with LLMs\nRecommendation:\nKeep the current setup as-is:\n\n\u2705 Use Pieces OS for the MCP integration (working perfectly)\n\u26a0\ufe0f Avoid Pieces Desktop until they fix the connection leak bug\n\u2705 Monitor connections occasionally with netstat if needed\nThe MCP integration is now stable and providing excellent work context tracking without the connection leak issues!\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

Snippet below. I had issues with it stopping suddenly. With help of vscode github copilot we determined that it was connections were used up. Investigation yielded that when Pieces Desktop not running only two connections present. When I started Pieces Desktop connections jumped to 50.  Below the MCP config snippet is copy of github copilot working session.\n\n\"pieces\": {\n\t\"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\",\n\t\"type\": \"http\",\n\t\"gallery\": true,\n\t\"autoStart\": false,\n\t\"timeout\": 30000,\n\t\"retryDelay\": 5000,\n\t\"maxRetries\": 3\n}\n\nI have started pieces desktop app. I informed it of our changes which it concurs. Can you check connection status and health of pieces now that I have stared pieces desktop?\n\nI'll check the connection status and health of the Pieces MCP server now that you've started the Pieces desktop app.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The connection leak problem is back! Let me check which processes are involved:\n\nProblem Identified! \ud83d\udea8\nThe issue is that starting the Pieces Desktop app (pieces_for_x.exe) has re-created the connection leak problem:\n\nProcess 35956: os_server.exe (Pieces OS) - listening on port 39300\nProcess 29660: Code.exe (VS Code) - 1 connection (good)\nProcess 37316: pieces_for_x.exe (Pieces Desktop) - 50+ connections (bad!)\n\nThe Root Cause:\nThe Pieces Desktop application itself has a connection leak bug - it's creating excessive connections to the Pieces OS server, just like we saw before with VS Code.\n\nSolutions:\nOption 1: Temporary Fix (Close Pieces Desktop)\nOption 2: Keep Pieces Desktop but Monitor\nIf you need the Pieces Desktop app running, you can:\n\nMonitor connections periodically\nRestart Pieces OS periodically to clear leaks\nReport this as a bug to Pieces support\nLet's check if closing the desktop app fixed the connections:\n\nPerfect! Now let's test the MCP connection:\n\npieces (MCP Server)\nConnection Status: \u2705 HEALTHY!\nPerfect! The Pieces MCP server is now working correctly with excellent connection health:\n\nCurrent Status:\n\u2705 2 established connections (down from 50+)\n\u2705 MCP server responding successfully\n\u2705 Clean connection state with minimal overhead\n\u2705 No connection leaks\nRoot Cause Confirmed:\nThe issue was specifically with the Pieces Desktop application (pieces_for_x.exe) creating excessive connections. The Pieces OS (os_server.exe) and VS Code MCP integration work fine together.\n\nCurrent Working Configuration:\nPieces OS: Running and healthy\nVS Code MCP: Connected with proper timeout settings\nPieces Desktop: Stopped (to prevent connection leaks)\nToday's Work Context Retrieved:\nFrom the MCP response, I can see you're actively working on:\n\nDatabase Mapping Projects:\n\nGWM-22316: Map database tables to GWMS UI elements\nGWM-22318: Customer SVP database migration\nCustomer and facility screen analysis\nDevelopment Tools:\n\nVS Code with MCP integration\nOracle SQL Developer for database work\nTime tracking with Toggl and Clockk\nRecent Focus Areas:\n\nVite platform work\nKeycloak maintenance\nResearch flow documentation with LLMs\nRecommendation:\nKeep the current setup as-is:\n\n\u2705 Use Pieces OS for the MCP integration (working perfectly)\n\u26a0\ufe0f Avoid Pieces Desktop until they fix the connection leak bug\n\u2705 Monitor connections occasionally with netstat if needed\nThe MCP integration is now stable and providing excellent work context tracking without the connection leak issues!\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
