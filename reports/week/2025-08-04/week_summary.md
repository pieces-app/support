## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and App Integration Issues
Users are experiencing difficulties with Pieces OS and app integration across Windows and macOS. Issues include application crashes due to MissingPlatformDirectoryException, MCP server SSE connection hangs in VS Code with Claude Code, and "Pieces Pro required" errors for Pro users.  Check data directory paths, ensure stable SSE connections, and verify Pro user authentication.

### 2. Pieces OS and App Integration Issues with Claude Code and Pro Features
Users are experiencing problems with Pieces OS and app integration with Claude Code and Pro features.  Issues include MCP server SSE connection hangs in Claude Code, "Pro required" errors despite having Pro, and Workstream Summary generation failures.  Check MCP server configuration, ensure Pieces Pro is active, and verify Pieces OS and app installation.

## Recommendations
- Investigate "MissingPlatformDirectoryException" on Windows related to data directory paths. This appears to be blocking core functionality and needs immediate attention.
- Troubleshoot MCP server SSE connection hangs, especially in VS Code with Claude Code integration.  This is affecting multiple users on macOS.
- Address the "Pieces Pro required" error for users who have already purchased Pro. Verify authentication and entitlement checks.
- Investigate Workstream Summary generation failures and the reported ApiException 511. Check application mode configurations.
