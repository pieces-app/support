## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Data Access and Performance Issues
Multiple users report issues with Pieces OS data access and performance. Symptoms include application crashes due to inability to locate data directories, MCP server connection hangs, and slow LTM queries after prolonged use.  Suggested solutions include restarting the machine, clearing LTM data (although the UI button is reported as broken), and reinstalling the application.  The underlying issue appears related to data directory management and potential performance bottlenecks with large datasets.
