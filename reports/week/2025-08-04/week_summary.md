## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS data access and LTM performance issues
Users report problems with Pieces OS accessing data directories on Windows and macOS, leading to application errors.  Additionally, LTM performance degrades over time, causing slow queries and empty results, especially after extended use.  Clearing LTM data through the UI is ineffective. Reinstalling or clearing all Pieces data temporarily resolves the issues.  The MCP server SSE connection hangs when integrating with Claude Code in VS Code, preventing tool registration.

### 2. Pieces Pro access issues and LTM performance degradation
Users are experiencing issues with Pieces Pro access despite having paid subscriptions, encountering errors when querying LTM, and observing performance degradation over time.  Additionally, the "Clear LTM Data" button is not functioning correctly.  Potential solutions include verifying Pro subscription status, optimizing LTM data management, and investigating the "Clear LTM Data" functionality.
