## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS data access and LTM performance issues
Users report difficulties accessing Pieces OS data directories on Windows and macOS, leading to application errors and LTM performance degradation over time.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional.  Suggested solutions include restarting the machine and checking data directory permissions.  Further investigation is needed into LTM query performance and data clearing functionality.

- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time

### 2. Users unable to upgrade to Pro
Multiple users report being unable to upgrade to Pieces Pro.  Clicking "Upgrade" leads to a blank checkout page with zero values, eventually returning an error.  One user, already on Pro, encountered a "Pro required" error message. This suggests issues with the upgrade process and Pro access validation.

**Related Issues:**
- [#808](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/808): Unable to upgrade subscription
- [#812](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/812): Unable to generate Workstream Summary
- [#811](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/811): I'm sorry. This feature requires Pieces Pro. Please upgrade your plan or change your LLM to continue.


## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the data directory access issue on Windows and macOS to resolve LTM performance degradation and "Clear LTM Data" button functionality.
- Address the MCP server SSE connection hang issue to enable proper Claude Code integration.
- Troubleshoot and resolve the Pro upgrade process to ensure users can successfully subscribe.
- Investigate the reports of Pro-required error messages for existing Pro users.
- Look into the issue of blank checkout pages during the upgrade process.
