## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop and LTM performance issues
Users report performance degradation with Pieces Desktop, including connection leaks on Windows and LTM query failures on macOS after prolonged use.  The LTM "Clear Data" button is also reported as non-functional.  Workarounds include closing Pieces Desktop to resolve connection leaks and removing all Pieces data to restore LTM functionality, though this is a disruptive solution. Sharing snippets via link/GitHub gist is also failing on Windows.

### 2. Pieces OS 12.1.1 Bugs on Windows and macOS
Users report issues with Pieces OS 12.1.1 across Windows and macOS. These include personal domain resetting to null.pieces.cloud, failure to share snippets via link or GitHub gist, and LTM performance degradation over time leading to unresponsiveness.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions.
