## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop App Bugs
Two bugs reported: 1. Sharing snippets via link/GitHub gist fails on Windows (v12.1.1). Error message: "404 Publisher Model not found." 2. LTM becomes unresponsive on macOS (v12.1.1) after weeks of use, querying returns nothing. Clearing LTM data button is non-functional. Reinstalling app temporarily resolves issue.
