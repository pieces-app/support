## Common Issues
### 1. MissingPlatformDirectoryException: Unable to get application documents directory
Pieces OS fails to start on Windows due to an inability to determine the application documents directory.  The error message "MissingPlatformDirectoryException(Unable to get application documents directory)" appears repeatedly in the logs.  This prevents the database from initializing and the UI from loading.  Restarting the machine does not resolve the issue.  Users are advised to contact support.

## Recommendations
- Investigate the "MissingPlatformDirectoryException: Unable to get application documents directory" error. This appears to be the primary issue affecting users on Windows and preventing the application from starting.  Focus on why the application is unable to determine the documents directory and implement a fix.
- Review the logs and error messages related to the "MissingPlatformDirectoryException" to identify the root cause. Check for common issues such as incorrect permissions, corrupted installation, or issues with environment variables.
- Consider adding better error handling and user messaging within the application. Instead of just logging the error, provide more user-friendly guidance on how to resolve the issue or what information to provide to support.
- Prioritize resolving issue #813 "Ensure Core Dependencies" as it has the highest activity level and is directly related to the "MissingPlatformDirectoryException".
- If the issue is related to a recent update, consider rolling back the update until a fix is available.  If not, explore providing a temporary workaround to affected users.
