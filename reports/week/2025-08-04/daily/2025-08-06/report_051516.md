## Common Issues
### 1. MissingPlatformDirectoryException: Unable to get application documents directory
Pieces OS fails to start on Windows due to an inability to determine the application documents directory.  Error message: "MissingPlatformDirectoryException(Unable to get application documents directory)". This prevents database initialization and subsequent application launch.  The issue occurs across multiple application launches and persists after restarts.  Suggested solution: Investigate directory permissions, environment variables, and application data paths on the affected Windows systems. Ensure the application has the necessary permissions to access the expected directory.
