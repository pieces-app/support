## Common Issues
### 1. Subscription Upgrade Fails, Blank Checkout Page
Users on macOS and Windows experience a blank checkout page with zero values when attempting to upgrade their subscription.  The page times out and returns to the previous view.  Windows users also encounter "MissingPlatformDirectoryException" errors. This has persisted for several weeks.  Suggested solutions include checking server-side error logs, verifying checkout page functionality, and investigating potential conflicts with OS versions 12.1.1 and 12.1.1.0.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the "Subscription Upgrade Fails, Blank Checkout Page" issue affecting macOS and Windows users.  Prioritize this due to its frequency and duration.
- Address the "MissingPlatformDirectoryException" error encountered by Windows users. This appears to be related to core dependencies and is preventing the application from opening.
- Review server-side error logs and checkout page functionality to identify the root cause of the upgrade failure.
- Check for potential conflicts with macOS versions 12.1.1 and Windows version 12.1.1.0 in relation to the upgrade failure.
- Improve error handling and messaging to provide more informative feedback to users when the upgrade process fails.
