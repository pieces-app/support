## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Copilot Service and Sharing Issues
Users are experiencing issues with the Pieces Copilot Service, encountering an 'Instance of 'fp'' error.  Additionally, sharing snippets via link or GitHub gist is failing on Windows.  The Pieces OS versions range from 11.0.4 to 12.1.1.  MacOS users are on 15.6 while the minimum supported is 12.0.0. Further investigation is needed into the 'fp' error and sharing functionality.
