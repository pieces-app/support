Copy improperly: if one copies `in-line code block` <img width=\"286\" height=\"104\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8260bc91-a15c-48eb-b625-0f697d2d3b3e\" /> through ctrl+c (rather than the \"copy button\" provided alongside), it is very likely (coupled with double click) to paste it into \" \ufffc \".\n\n3. Feature: Hopefully, the `in-line code block` can be partially copied (rather than merely allowing all copies) like the inter-line code block to improve efficiency.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
