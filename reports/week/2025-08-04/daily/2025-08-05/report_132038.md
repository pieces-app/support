| [#810](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/810) | MCP Server SSE Connection Hangs - No Tools Available in Claude Code | 4.26 |
| [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805) | LTM gets gunged up over time | 4.04 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS LTM and MCP Issues
Users report problems with Pieces OS Long Term Memory (LTM) and Model Context Protocol (MCP). LTM queries become unresponsive after weeks of use, possibly due to data overload.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also ineffective.  MCP integration with Claude Code fails, with the SSE connection hanging indefinitely, preventing tool registration.  Reinstalling Pieces OS and clearing data temporarily resolves LTM issues. The MCP issue seems related to SSE buffering.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the SSE connection issue affecting the MCP integration with Claude Code (Issue #810). This appears to be a major blocker for users.
- Address the performance degradation of LTM queries after extended use (Issue #805).  Explore options for optimizing LTM data handling or implementing data cleanup mechanisms.
- Investigate why the "Clear LTM Data" button is ineffective and fix it to allow users to manage their LTM data.
- Improve communication with users regarding known issues and their progress.  Provide updates on bug fixes and workarounds.
