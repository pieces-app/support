| [#810](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/810) | MCP Server SSE Connection Hangs - No Tools Available in Claude Code | 6.58 |
| [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805) | LTM gets gunged up over time | 3.92 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS LTM and MCP Issues
Users report issues with Pieces OS Long Term Memory (LTM) queries becoming unresponsive after extended use and the MCP SSE connection hanging, preventing tool registration in Claude Code.  LTM issues may require clearing LTM data, though the in-app clear function is reported as non-functional.  The MCP issue seems related to an SSE buffering problem. Both affect macOS users on Pieces OS 12.1.1.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the MCP SSE connection issue affecting macOS users on Pieces OS 12.1.1. This appears to be a high-impact issue affecting Claude Code integration.
- Address the LTM performance degradation and data clearing issues reported by macOS users.  The inability to clear LTM data exacerbates the problem.
- Investigate why the "Clear LTM Data" button is not functioning. This prevents users from resolving LTM issues themselves.
- Prioritize bug fixes related to core functionalities like LTM and MCP to improve user experience and reduce support tickets.
