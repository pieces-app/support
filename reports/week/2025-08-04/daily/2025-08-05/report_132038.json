While the SSE endpoint responds initially, it hangs indefinitely, preventing MCP tools from being registered or used. This affects Claude Code integration both as a standalone CLI and when used within VS Code.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Install Pieces OS and Pieces app\n2. Login in the app\n3. Configure MCP in Claude Code's ~/.claude.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pieces\": {\n    \"type\": \"sse\",\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\"\n}\n```\n\n4. Attempt to use Pieces MCP tools (e.g., mcp__pieces__ask_pieces_ltm) in Claude Code\n5. Tools are not available despite server being configured\n6. Same issue occurs whether using Claude Code in terminal or integrated with VS Code\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- SSE endpoint (http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse) responds with:\n\n```\nevent: endpoint\ndata: /model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages\n```\n\n- Connection then hangs indefinitely (SSE buffering issue)\n- Both Pieces OS and Pieces app processes are running\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

The only explanation I can come up with is that it's just getting too big. The Workstream is, however, updating fine.\n\nRemoving all my Pieces data gets the LTM working again, but then I end up with this situation later. This is the third time I've been through this loop. It's really frustrating, because when I actually need the LTM, it fails.\n\nThe Clear LTM Data button doesn't work, just returning to Try again, from All Data to even for just clearing an hour of data.\n\nI haven't cleared the LTM (well, I've tried, but the Clear LTM Data button doesn't work) so we have a live broken environment to debug with. I'm more than happy to assist with debugging this - let me know what you need!\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
