## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users reported various issues with the Pieces desktop application, including incorrect calendar days in chat summaries on macOS, incomplete code generation from LLMs on Windows, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations on macOS.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement fixes for these issues across different operating systems and features.

- [#714](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/714): Arrow keys inverted when scrolling through Copilot conversation

### 2. Pieces Software Bugs and LLM Code Generation Issues
Users report issues with Pieces software, including the CLI's LTM feature not working, the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading, and LLMs not providing complete or correct code.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions for these diverse problems. Sharing logs and specific examples can help in troubleshooting.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High Resource Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, requiring a restart.  High CPU and GPU usage are also observed, particularly on older macOS systems with Intel chipsets.  The issue appears to be related to Long Term Memory (LTM) and occurs across different Windows and macOS versions and Pieces Desktop versions.

### 4. Invalid Discord Invite Links Across Pieces Platforms
Users report invalid Discord invite links on Pieces OS, the Pieces website, and Pieces documentation.  The reported links include discord.gg/ubn8JFAXQ7, discord.gg/getpieces, and discord.com/invite/getpieces.  A common solution is to create a non-expiring Discord invite link and update all instances across the platforms.

**Related Issues:**
- [#724](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/724): Discord link provided is invalid in Pieces OS
- [#723](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/723): Discord link provided is invalid on the website
- [#718](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/718): Pieces crash when on Chrome tab with a lot of content

### 5. LTM Issues and Unexpected Behavior in Pieces OS
Users report issues with LTM not clearing as expected in Pieces OS and Pieces CLI.  Symptoms include prolonged time to first token, copilot still retrieving cleared information, and CLI not accessing LTM context. Additionally, Pieces Desktop experiences random freezes after inactivity, especially following chat interactions, potentially related to LTM usage.

**Related Issues:**
- [#709](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/709): LTM does not clear
- [#713](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/713): LTM not working in Pieces CLI
- [#719](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/719): Pieces Desktop freezes after inactivity


## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the issue of Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after chat usage, as it affects Windows and older macOS systems and is potentially linked to LTM. Investigate high CPU/GPU usage related to this issue.
- Address the various bugs reported in the Pieces desktop application, including calendar day inaccuracies in chat summaries on macOS, incomplete code generation from LLMs on Windows, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations on macOS.
- Investigate and fix the issues related to LTM not clearing correctly in Pieces OS and CLI, as it impacts copilot performance and CLI functionality.
- Replace all instances of invalid Discord invite links across Pieces OS, the website, and documentation with a non-expiring link.
- Address the reported issues with LLMs not providing complete or correct code, impacting both the desktop application and potentially other integrations. Encourage users to share logs and specific examples for better troubleshooting.
- Investigate and resolve the specific software bugs affecting the Pieces CLI (LTM feature not working) and the VS Code extension (copy button endlessly loading).
