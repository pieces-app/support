## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users reported various bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application across macOS and Windows. These include incorrect calendar day associations in chat summaries, incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement fixes.

### 2. Pieces Software Bugs and Feature Requests
Users are encountering issues with Pieces software, including the Pieces CLI not utilizing LTM context, the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading, and LLMs not providing complete or accurate code.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement solutions.  Users are requesting improvements to LLM code generation capabilities.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High Resource Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, requiring a restart.  High CPU and GPU usage are also observed, sometimes freezing the entire system. Issues occur across Windows and macOS, with varying Pieces OS and Desktop versions.  Users with lower system resources seem more affected. Further investigation into resource management and chat interaction is needed.

### 4. Invalid Discord Invite Links Across Pieces Platforms
Multiple reports indicate invalid Discord invite links on the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  The links provided include discord.gg/getpieces, discord.com/invite/getpieces, and discord.gg/ubn8JFAXQ7.  A permanent, non-expiring link should replace these instances across all platforms.
