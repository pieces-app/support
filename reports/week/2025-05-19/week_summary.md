## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users reported various bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application across macOS and Windows. These include incorrect calendar day associations in chat summaries, incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement fixes for these issues.

- [#716](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/716): llms won't provide me the full code i need
- [#714](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/714): Arrow keys inverted when scrolling through Copilot conversation

### 2. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High Resource Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, on Windows and macOS.  High CPU and GPU usage is also observed, particularly on older macOS systems with Intel chipsets. Issues occur with various Pieces OS versions (11.3.6-11.4.1) and Desktop versions (4.1.2-4.1.3).  Restarting the application temporarily resolves the freezing issue. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and provide a permanent solution.

### 3. Pieces for Windows Freezes/Crashes with LTM
Multiple reports on Windows show Pieces freezing or crashing, often related to LTM usage or large content. Issues appear across Pieces CLI, Desktop app, and OS versions 11.3.6-11.4.1. CLI shows LTM context failure. Desktop freezes after inactivity, especially after chat interaction with LTM enabled.  Large content in browser tabs also triggers crashes.  Users report no relevant logs. Further investigation needed to isolate LTM's role and potential memory issues.

- [#713](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/713): LTM not working in Pieces CLI
- [#718](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/718): Pieces crash when on Chrome tab with a lot of content
- [#719](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/719): Pieces Desktop freezes after inactivity

### 4. Pieces for Windows Freezes and Crashes
Users report Pieces for Windows freezing and crashing under various conditions.  One user experienced an indefinite loading state with the copy button in VS Code extension. Another user reported crashes when viewing large amounts of content in Chrome, such as long logs. A third user observed frequent freezes after periods of inactivity, especially after interacting with chat features.  Issues appear across recent Pieces versions (11.3.6.0, 11.4.0, 11.4.1).

**Related Issues:**
- [#712](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/712): copy button in pieces vs code extension keeps loading indefinitely.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application related to calendar day associations, incomplete code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling.
- Address the freezing and high resource usage issues reported on Windows and macOS, particularly after chat usage and on older macOS systems with Intel chipsets. Investigate LTM's potential role in these issues.
- Resolve the LTM context failure in Pieces CLI on Windows and ensure consistent LTM functionality across all platforms.
- Investigate and fix the crashes reported on Windows related to large content in Chrome tabs and after inactivity, especially following chat interactions.
- Address the indefinite loading state of the copy button in the VS Code extension on Windows.
- Prioritize the most active tickets, particularly #716 (LLM code generation), #718 (Windows crashes with large content), and #710 (High resource usage on older macOS).
