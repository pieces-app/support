## Common Issues
### 1. Issues with Pieces Desktop Application across different functionalities
Users are experiencing various issues with the Pieces Desktop Application. These include incorrect calendar day mapping when summarizing activities, incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations.  The calendar issue involves mismatched days and dates, affecting activity summaries. The code generation problem results in incomplete or inaccurate code outputs. The scrolling issue involves inverted up and down arrow key functionality within Copilot conversations on macOS.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement solutions for these diverse issues across different operating systems and application versions.

### 2. Pieces Software Bugs and Feature Requests
Users are reporting issues with Pieces software, including the Pieces CLI not utilizing LTM context, the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading, and LLMs not providing complete or accurate code.  Further investigation is needed to determine root causes and solutions.  Consider improved LLM integration, bug fixes for the CLI and VS Code extension, and enhanced code generation capabilities.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High Resource Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, on Windows and macOS.  High CPU and GPU usage is also observed, particularly on older macOS systems with Intel chipsets. Issues occur with various Pieces OS versions (11.3.6-11.4.1) and Desktop versions (4.1.2-4.1.3).  Restarting the application temporarily resolves the freezing issue. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and provide a permanent solution.

### 4. LTM not clearing or working as expected
Users report LTM not clearing after following the standard procedure in Pieces OS and Desktop.  One user reports LTM not working in Pieces CLI.  Symptoms include copilot still answering questions based on cleared information and CLI not accessing LTM context.  Suggested solutions include verifying LTM settings, checking for software updates, and ensuring correct model versions are used.

### 5. Invalid Discord Link and Connection Issues
Users are experiencing issues with invalid Discord invite links across the Pieces OS desktop app, website, and documentation.  Additionally, a user reported a "Format Exception: Invalid Port" error when the desktop application attempts to connect to Pieces core services, possibly due to antivirus software interference.  Recommended solutions include verifying and updating Discord links and checking antivirus settings.

**Related Issues:**
- [#672](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/672): Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect
