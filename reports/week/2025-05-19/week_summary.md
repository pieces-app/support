## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users reported various bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application across macOS and Windows. These include incorrect calendar day associations in chat summaries, incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement fixes for these issues.

### 2. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High Resource Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, requiring a restart.  High CPU and GPU usage are also observed, particularly on older hardware or with content-heavy web pages. This occurs across Windows and macOS, potentially related to LTM and recent updates.  Check for conflicting apps, update Pieces to the latest version, and monitor resource usage.

### 3. Pieces for Windows: LTM and freezing issues
Users on Windows report issues with LTM not working in the CLI, receiving a "404 Publisher Model not found" error.  Additionally, Pieces Desktop is freezing, sometimes after inactivity or when interacting with content-heavy Chrome tabs.  Freezes are more frequent after the May 22nd update.  LTM is enabled with Claude 3.7 Sonnet.  Users have checked for existing issues.

### 4. Pieces for Windows freezes, crashes, or buttons fail to load
Users on Windows are experiencing freezing and crashing of the Pieces desktop app and VS Code extension, especially when interacting with content-heavy web pages or after periods of inactivity.  The copy button in the VS Code extension can also get stuck loading indefinitely. Issues appear across recent Pieces versions (11.3.6.0, 11.4.0, 11.4.1).  Users should check their system resources (RAM, CPU) and ensure Pieces is up-to-date. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause.
