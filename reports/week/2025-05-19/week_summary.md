## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs Reported by Users
Users reported various bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application across macOS and Windows. Issues include incorrect calendar day mapping in chat summaries, incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement fixes. Users should provide detailed steps to reproduce the issues and specify their OS and application versions.

- [#714](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/714): Arrow keys inverted when scrolling through Copilot conversation

### 2. Pieces Software Bugs and LLM Code Generation Issues
Users report issues with Pieces software, including the CLI's LTM feature not working, the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading, and LLMs not providing complete or correct code.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions for these diverse problems. Sharing logs and specific examples can help in troubleshooting.

- [#712](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/712): copy button in pieces vs code extension keeps loading indefinitely.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High CPU Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, requiring a restart.  High CPU usage and slow performance are also observed, particularly on older macOS systems with Intel chipsets. Issues occur across different Pieces OS versions (11.3.6-11.4.1) and Desktop versions (4.1.2-4.1.3).  Large amounts of content in browser tabs may exacerbate the freezing issue.

- [#718](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/718): Pieces crash when on Chrome tab with a lot of content
- [#710](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/710): Long Term Memory 2 stills slow down my macbook pro with intel chipset.

### 4. LTM Issues in Pieces OS and Desktop
Users report problems with Long Term Memory (LTM) feature, including failure to clear LTM,  inaccurate context retrieval, and freezing after inactivity. Issues appear across Pieces Desktop and CLI on Windows.  Further investigation needed to identify root cause and solutions.  Users have tried clearing LTM via different methods without success.

**Related Issues:**
- [#709](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/709): LTM does not clear
- [#713](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/713): LTM not working in Pieces CLI
- [#719](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/719): Pieces Desktop freezes after inactivity


## Recommendations
- Investigate and fix the LTM issues reported across Pieces OS, Desktop, and CLI. Prioritize the "LTM does not clear" issue (709) and the "LTM not working in Pieces CLI" issue (713).
- Address the Pieces Desktop freezing and high CPU usage issues. Focus on the reports related to inactivity after chat usage (719) and large amounts of content in browser tabs (718). Investigate performance on older macOS systems with Intel chipsets (710).
- Resolve the bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application, particularly the incorrect calendar day mapping in chat summaries (720), incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs (716), and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations (714).
- Investigate and fix the issue with the copy button endlessly loading in the VS Code extension (712).
- Improve LLM code generation accuracy and completeness as reported in multiple tickets (716).  Gather more information from users about specific instances where the code is incorrect or incomplete.
- Consider adding more detailed logging to Pieces OS and Desktop to better diagnose freezing and crashing issues.
- Communicate to users the importance of providing detailed steps to reproduce issues, OS and application versions, and logs when reporting bugs.
- Analyze the frequency of LLM-related issues (e.g., "Error generating summary: 404 Publisher Model") and investigate potential solutions or workarounds.
