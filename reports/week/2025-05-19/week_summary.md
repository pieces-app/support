## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs
Users reported various bugs in the Pieces Desktop Application across macOS and Windows. These include incorrect calendar day associations in chat summaries, incomplete or incorrect code generation from LLMs, and inverted arrow key scrolling in Copilot conversations.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and implement fixes for these issues.

### 2. Pieces Software Bugs and Feature Requests
Users are reporting issues with Pieces software, including the Pieces CLI not utilizing LTM context, the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading, and LLMs not providing complete or accurate code.  Further investigation is needed to determine root causes and solutions for these diverse issues across different Pieces components.

### 3. Pieces Desktop Freezes and High Resource Usage
Users report Pieces Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat, requiring a restart.  High CPU and GPU usage are also observed, particularly on older hardware or with content-heavy Chrome tabs. This occurs across Windows and macOS, with varying Pieces OS/Desktop versions.  Check for conflicting apps, update Pieces to the latest version, and monitor resource usage.

### 4. Invalid Discord Invite Links Across Pieces Platforms
Multiple reports indicate invalid Discord invite links on the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  The links provided include discord.gg/getpieces, discord.com/invite/getpieces, and discord.gg/ubn8JFAXQ7.  A permanent, non-expiring link should replace these instances across all platforms.

Symptoms include the copilot still having context after clearing LTM and CLI not accessing LTM context.  Users have tried clearing LTM via Pieces OS and Desktop, checking app permissions, and deleting chats, but the issue persists.
