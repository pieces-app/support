Start Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers and use them as normal.\n2. Open a tab with a large amount of content. In my case, it was a GitLab CI job with a 6k line job log. I also experienced crashes with ArgoCD when having 100+ apps on a page.\n3. Both Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers crash. There are no corresponding log records in the Support directory, only logs about application startup.\n\nSometimes it freezes Chrome completely.\n\nI have 16GB RAM, 12 vCPU, and have never experienced such behavior without Pieces.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate the crash reported in ticket #718 related to Chrome tabs with extensive content, focusing on the interaction between Pieces OS/Developers and Chrome on Windows with high resource specs (16GB RAM, 12 vCPUs).  Consider the impact of the Early Access Program feature mentioned.",
    "Implement better logging for Pieces OS and Developers to capture crash details, especially when no logs are currently generated in the Support directory.",
    "Given the frequency of the reported issue and its impact on stability, prioritize a fix for the crash to improve user experience and reduce support tickets in the future.",
    "Develop a test case to reliably reproduce the crash scenario described in ticket #718 (Chrome tab with large content, e.g., long logs or numerous apps).",
    "Consider providing users with temporary workarounds or mitigation steps while a permanent fix is being developed, such as limiting the content size in Chrome tabs or adjusting resource allocation for Pieces OS/Developers.",
    "Monitor support tickets for similar crash reports to identify any patterns or additional factors contributing to the issue.",
    "Communicate the status of the investigation and any planned fixes to the affected users to manage expectations and maintain transparency.",
    "Review the Early Access Program feature involved in the crash to identify potential issues or conflicts with Chrome or system resources.",
    "Investigate if the issue is specific to Chrome or if it also affects other browsers with similar content loads.",
    "Explore potential resource conflicts or memory management issues within Pieces OS/Developers that might be triggered by the large content in Chrome tabs.",
    "Consider adding resource usage monitoring to Pieces OS/Developers to better understand its behavior under heavy load and identify potential bottlenecks.",
    "Investigate the Chrome freezing issue mentioned in the report to determine if it's related to the Pieces crash or a separate problem.",
    "Test Pieces OS/Developers with different Chrome versions and configurations to isolate the issue and identify potential compatibility problems.",
    "If the issue is related to the Early Access Program feature, consider disabling or modifying the feature until a fix is available.",
    "Document the troubleshooting steps and findings related to this issue in the support knowledge base to help support agents and users resolve similar problems in the future.",
    "Collect user feedback on the frequency and severity of the crash to prioritize development efforts and assess the impact on user workflows.",
    "Analyze the crash dumps (if any are generated) to pinpoint the root cause of the issue and guide the development of a fix.",
    "Consider implementing automated crash reporting within Pieces OS/Developers to gather more detailed information about crashes and facilitate faster debugging.",
    "Investigate potential interactions with other software or extensions running on the affected systems that might contribute to the crash.",
    "Review the system requirements for Pieces OS/Developers and ensure they are aligned with the user's hardware configuration (16GB RAM, 12 vCPUs)."
