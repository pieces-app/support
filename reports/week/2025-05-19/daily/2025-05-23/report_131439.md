## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Freezes After Inactivity
Pieces Desktop (4.1.3) on Windows freezes after a period of inactivity, especially after interacting with a chat with LTM enabled and using Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the default LLM.  The issue started frequently occurring after the May 22nd update. Restarting Pieces Desktop is the current workaround.  The freeze doesn't occur if the user hasn't interacted with a chat prior to the inactivity period.
