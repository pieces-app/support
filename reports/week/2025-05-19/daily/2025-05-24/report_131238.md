## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Link and Pieces Desktop Freezes
Two distinct issues reported: 1. Pieces Desktop application freezes after a period of inactivity, especially after interacting with a chat. The freezing issue started after latest update on May 22nd.  2. Invalid Discord invite links are present on Pieces OS, the Pieces website, and the support page. Users suggest creating a non-expiring link as a solution.

### 2. Invalid Links and Icons Reported Across Pieces OS and Website
Multiple reports indicate broken Discord invite links on the Pieces OS app, main website, and documentation, alongside an incorrect icon for the Sublime Text plugin in the Pieces OS settings.  Users suggest creating non-expiring Discord links and using the correct Sublime Text icon to resolve these issues.
