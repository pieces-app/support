## Common Issues
### 1. Issues with Pieces Copilot Functionality
Users report problems with Copilot, including incomplete or incorrect code generation (Windows) and inverted arrow key scrolling in conversations (macOS).  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions for these issues.  The code generation issue may stem from limitations in the LLMs used, while the scrolling issue seems specific to the macOS desktop application.
