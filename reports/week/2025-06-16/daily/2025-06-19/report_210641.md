## Common Issues
### 1. LTM and Authentication Issues in Pieces OS and CLI
Users are experiencing issues with LTM functionality in the Pieces CLI and desktop application, encountering 404 errors related to the Gemini-Pro model.  Additionally, authentication problems are reported, with verification codes not being received.  Issues span across Windows and macOS platforms and various Pieces OS versions (11.3.6, 12.0.0).  Check LTM connection and model access.  Verify authentication server status and email delivery.

### 2. Pieces OS 12.0.0 Desktop and CLI Issues
Users report issues with Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Desktop and CLI. Desktop app initialization hangs on Linux, login authentication fails on macOS, and CLI's LTM integration is broken on Windows.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and potential solutions across platforms.  Check logs, network connectivity, and authentication services.
