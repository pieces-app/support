Yesterday I restarted pieces for the first time in weeks, and it said I needed to sign in before I can continue.\nFirst the sign in link wouldn't work. Then I noticed there was a Pieces OS update too. After I clicked that update I got back to the same screen and the link would work.\nSo I entered my mail address and it said I should get a verification code, which never arrived. So I tried again later and still nothing happened. I decided to let it rest until today and try it again, but still the same result.\n\nAlso, please allow people to continue offline if you can't get your online authentication to work properly.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

The new version broke the installation completely and the Desktop application doesn't move past the first step of initialization itself. I thought it was a problem with my system, but I tried a fresh install on a completely different device and same behaviour was observed. Please let me know if there is a way to revert back to the older version till the time this issue gets resolved. Also, please let me know if any further details are required to assist you with the resolution.\n\nDistro: Ubuntu 24.04\nArch: x86_64\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
