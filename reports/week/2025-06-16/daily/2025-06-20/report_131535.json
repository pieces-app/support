Yesterday I restarted pieces for the first time in weeks, and it said I needed to sign in before I can continue.\nFirst the sign in link wouldn't work. Then I noticed there was a Pieces OS update too. After I clicked that update I got back to the same screen and the link would work.\nSo I entered my mail address and it said I should get a verification code, which never arrived. So I tried again later and still nothing happened. I decided to let it rest until today and try it again, but still the same result.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
