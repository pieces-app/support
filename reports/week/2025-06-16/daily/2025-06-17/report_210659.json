The first issue lacks detailed reproduction steps. The second issue points to high CPU usage in Chrome during scrolling and frequent DOM mutations as potential causes. Disabling LTM 2.5 resolves the browsing freeze.  Further investigation is needed for both issues to identify the root cause and implement solutions.",

Dynamic element(s) are a scroll linked table of contents.\n\n**What happens:**\n\n* Chrome CPU usage spikes (~50% CPU) during scrolling.\n* Memory usage stays stable.\n* Chrome freezes for 10-15 seconds, unfreezes, and freezes again when scrolling resumes.\n* Disabling LTM 2.5 resolves the freeze (Pieces OS still running).\n\n**Expected:**\nPieces should handle large pages without freezing or jumping while scrolling.\n\n---\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1. Enable LTM 2.5 in Pieces OS \n2. Load a large page (https://claritymobileapi.claritycrm.com/Help/Document).\n3. Scroll through the page.\n4. Observe Chrome freeze / become unresponsive as Pieces tries to capture context.\n---\n\n### **Environment**\n\n* OS: Windows 11 Pro\n* Chrome: 137.0.7151.104\n* Pieces OS: 12.0.0\n* LTM Version: 2.5\n* Pieces Chrome Extension: Tested with and without--same result. \n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n\nI observed high-frequency DOM mutations via MutationObserver, but unsure if root cause (found 80-150 DOM mutations per scroll event)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
