| [#754](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/754) | LTM-2.5 causes Chrome to freeze on large dynamic pages | 10.25 |
| [#459](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/459) | Bug: unable to cancel the download of an LLLM | 2.65 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Application Freezes During Specific Actions
Users report application freezes on Windows during LLLM download cancellation and when browsing large dynamic web pages with Pieces OS and LTM 2.5 enabled.  The first issue lacks detailed reproduction steps. The second issue points to high CPU usage in Chrome during scrolling and frequent DOM mutations as potential causes. Disabling LTM 2.5 resolves the browsing freeze.  Further investigation is needed for both issues to identify the root cause and implement solutions.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and address the application freezing issue during LLLM download cancellation and large dynamic webpage browsing. Prioritize the webpage issue due to higher activity and potential impact on user experience.
- Gather more detailed reproduction steps for the LLLM download cancellation issue to facilitate debugging.
- Optimize LTM 2.5 performance, particularly its interaction with dynamic web pages and DOM mutations, to prevent browser freezes.
- Consider providing users with temporary workarounds or guidance on mitigating the freezing issues while a permanent fix is being developed.
- Monitor incoming support tickets for similar reports and track the effectiveness of implemented solutions.
