## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Fails to Access LTM Data via MCP
Users report the `ask_pieces_ltm` MCP tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" despite functional LTM in the Pieces application.  The issue occurs across different clients and operating systems. Other MCP tools like `create_pieces_memory` work correctly.  Potential root causes include authentication issues, data access layer bugs, permissions problems, or initialization errors within the MCP server's interaction with the LTM data.
