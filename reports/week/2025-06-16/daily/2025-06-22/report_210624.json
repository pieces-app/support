      "description": "The Pieces OS VS Code extension experiences significant slowdowns after sending several messages to Pieces Copilot.  Symptoms include delayed UI response, slow LLM responses, and increased CPU/RAM usage. This occurs on Windows using Pieces OS 12.0.0.  A potential solution involves investigating and optimizing the extension's message handling and resource management.",

CPU usage and RAM usage also spikes when this occurs.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
