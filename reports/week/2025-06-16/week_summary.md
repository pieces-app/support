## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Performance Issues and LTM Integration Failures
Multiple users report performance problems with Pieces OS, including Chrome freezes with LTM 2.5 enabled on large webpages, LTM functionality not working in the Pieces CLI, and overall application slowness/unresponsiveness.  Issues appear across different OS versions (Windows, macOS) and Pieces components (Desktop, CLI).  Disabling LTM 2.5 sometimes resolves freezing, but core performance issues persist. Further investigation needed into LTM integration and overall application optimization.

- [#713](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/713): LTM not working in Pieces CLI
- [#755](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/755): Pieces has become increasingly slow and is now unresponsive

### 2. Pieces OS and Desktop App Performance Issues and Login Failures
Users are experiencing login failures due to verification codes not arriving, slow performance, and unresponsiveness, especially with "New chats."  The Pieces team has acknowledged a service interruption affecting cloud-connected features and is investigating.  Users are encouraged to monitor official updates for service restoration.

### 3. LTM connection failures and slow performance
Users report LTM connectivity issues across Pieces CLI and Desktop, including 404 errors for the Gemini-Pro model and timeouts.  Slow performance and unresponsiveness are also observed, even with different LLM models.  Suggested solutions include verifying LTM settings, checking network connectivity, and ensuring sufficient resources.

**Related Issues:**
- [#713](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/713): LTM not working in Pieces CLI
- [#758](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/758): Error Activating LTM-2.5 During Onboarding
- [#755](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/755): Pieces has become increasingly slow and is now unresponsive

### 4. LTM and model integration issues causing failures and slowdowns
Users report LTM context extraction failures in CLI and MCP tools despite functional LTM in the desktop app.  This suggests a disconnect between the LTM data access layer and these interfaces. Slowdowns and unresponsiveness with new chats, even with LTM disabled, point to broader model integration issues.  Suggested solutions include verifying MCP server authentication, data access permissions, and investigating potential bottlenecks in model communication.

**Related Issues:**
- [#747](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/747): MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" despite functional LTM
- [#713](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/713): LTM not working in Pieces CLI
- [#755](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/755): Pieces has become increasingly slow and is now unresponsive

### 5. Pieces OS 12.0.0 Desktop App Issues
Users are experiencing issues with the Pieces OS 12.0.0 Desktop application.  One user on Ubuntu 24.04 reports the app freezing at the initialization screen. Another user on macOS cannot log in due to verification code issues.  These issues may be related to ongoing service interruptions affecting cloud-connected features.  Check the Pieces status page for updates.
