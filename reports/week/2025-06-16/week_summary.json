Verify MCP Server is Running\n```bash\nlsof -i :39300\n# Shows Pieces OS listening on port 39300 with multiple established connections\n```\n\n### 2. Confirm Tools are Available\n```bash\ncurl -N http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse \\\n  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' &\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tools/list\"}'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 Successfully returns tools list with `ask_pieces_ltm` tool schema\n\n### 3. Test create_pieces_memory (Working)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"create_pieces_memory\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"summary\":\"Test memory\",\n        \"summary_description\":\"Testing connection\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 `\"Long term memory successfully created\"`\n\n### 4. Test ask_pieces_ltm (Failing)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":3,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"ask_pieces_ltm\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"question\":\"What did I work on today?\",\n        \"chat_llm\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u274c `{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Failed to extract context\"}],\"isError\":true}`\n\n## Attempted Variations (All Failed)\n\n### Minimal Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"hello\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n}\n```\n\n### With Application Sources\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What terminal commands have I run recently?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\"],\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\"\n}\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What did I work on today?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\", \"Google Chrome\"],\n  \"topics\": [\"terminal\", \"commands\", \"recent\"],\n  \"related_questions\": [\"What was I working on?\", \"What debugging was I doing?\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Different Application Sources Tested\n- `[\"Warp\"]`\n- `[\"Google Chrome\", \"Safari\", \"Obsidian\"]`\n- `[\"Claude\"]`\n- Multiple combinations from the schema list\n\n**All variations return the same error.**\n\n## Troubleshooting Attempted\n\n1. \u2705 **Restarted Pieces MCP server** - Issue persists\n2. \u2705 **Verified Pieces OS permissions** - Has necessary macOS permissions\n3. \u2705 **Confirmed LTM data collection** - User sees active workstream data\n4. \u2705 **Tested different MCP clients** - Same error in Warp Agent Mode, Claude, and direct curl\n5. \u2705 **Used proper SSE endpoint** - `/sse` for responses, `/messages` for requests\n6. \u2705 **Verified JSON-RPC format** - Matches working `create_pieces_memory` calls\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `ask_pieces_ltm` tool should return contextual information from the user's LTM data, similar to how the main Pieces application shows workstream summaries and context.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nEvery call to `ask_pieces_ltm` returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Failed to extract context\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis appears to be an **MCP server implementation issue** where:\n\n1. The `ask_pieces_ltm` tool is properly registered and callable\n2. The MCP communication protocol works correctly\n3. The underlying LTM system has data and functions properly\n4. There's a disconnect between the MCP tool implementation and the LTM data access layer\n\n## Potential Root Causes\n\n1. **Authentication/Session Issue**: MCP server process may lack proper authentication to access LTM data\n2. **Data Access Layer Bug**: `ask_pieces_ltm` implementation may be using incorrect API calls to access LTM\n3. **Permissions Issue**: MCP server may not have the same data access permissions as the main Pieces application\n4. **Initialization Problem**: LTM access for MCP tools may require additional setup or initialization\n\n## Request\n\nPlease investigate the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation in the Pieces MCP server to identify why it cannot access the same LTM data that is clearly available to the main Pieces application.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Issue occurs consistently across different MCP clients (Warp, Claude)\n- `create_pieces_memory` works perfectly, confirming MCP communication\n- LTM is actively collecting and displaying data in the main Pieces app\n- No relevant error logs found in system logs or Pieces application logs\n- Multiple parameter variations attempted with identical results\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
