The new version broke the installation completely and the Desktop application doesn't move past the first step of initialization itself. I thought it was a problem with my system, but I tried a fresh install on a completely different device and same behaviour was observed. Please let me know if there is a way to revert back to the older version till the time this issue gets resolved. Also, please let me know if any further details are required to assist you with the resolution.\n\nDistro: Ubuntu 24.04\nArch: x86_64\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
