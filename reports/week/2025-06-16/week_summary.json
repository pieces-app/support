Specifically, users may notice degraded performance or unresponsiveness in the following areas:\n\n- Copilot responses\n- Workstream summaries\n- Other cloud-assisted functionalities, such as snippet transforms and snippet discovery\n\nThe interruption is tied to unexpected issues with specific cloud services, and we are also actively investigating the possibility of a cyber-related incident as part of our root cause analysis.\n\nWe want to reassure all users that your data security and privacy are not impacted. As a precaution, our security and infrastructure teams are treating this with the highest level of urgency and diligence. We are taking all necessary steps to investigate and remediate the issue.\n\nOur engineering and security teams are working around the clock to restore full functionality. We\u2019ll continue to provide updates in this thread as we learn more and make progress.\n\nYou can track the status of this interruption here and we\u2019ll notify you once normal service has resumed.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. If you have urgent concerns or need support, please reach out via our usual support channels.\n\nThe Pieces Team\nNo comments found on this issue.",

The new version broke the installation completely and the Desktop application doesn't move past the first step of initialization itself. I thought it was a problem with my system, but I tried a fresh install on a completely different device and same behaviour was observed. Please let me know if there is a way to revert back to the older version till the time this issue gets resolved. Also, please let me know if any further details are required to assist you with the resolution.\n\nDistro: Ubuntu 24.04\nArch: x86_64\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
