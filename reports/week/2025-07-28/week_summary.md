## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication and usability issues in Pieces OS for Windows
Users are experiencing authentication errors ("An error occurred in the authentication flow") on new installations of Pieces for Windows, primarily when using the desktop application.  Additionally, there are reports of usability issues involving unintended selection behavior, possibly related to stuck shift/mouse click events.  Troubleshooting steps include checking firewall settings, browser extensions, and different browsers. Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and solutions for both issues.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
- [#803](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/803): it doesnt stop selecting, it seems like "shift" or "mouse 1" is locked
- [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804): Unable to generate Workstream Summary

### 2. Pieces OS and extensions incompatibility issues
Users report incompatibility between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  The Raycast extension triggers errors in recent Raycast versions, while the core Pieces app experiences LTM query failures after prolonged use. Clearing LTM data is ineffective.  Users suggest updating the Raycast extension and addressing LTM performance issues.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and resolve the authentication flow error on Windows, focusing on new installations and potential conflicts with firewall/browser settings.
- Address the unintended selection behavior on Windows, possibly related to stuck shift/mouse click events, to improve usability.
- Update the Raycast extension to ensure compatibility with the latest Raycast versions.
- Investigate and address the LTM query failures after prolonged use, including exploring performance optimization and data clearing functionality.
- Prioritize resolving issues affecting core functionality (authentication, selection behavior, LTM queries) to improve user experience and reduce support ticket volume.
