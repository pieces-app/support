## Common Issues
### 1. LTM performance degrades over time, becomes unresponsive
Users report that the Long Term Memory (LTM) functionality slows down and eventually stops returning results after several weeks of use.  Clearing LTM data sometimes resolves the issue temporarily.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional. This affects both desktop application and MCP access.  Users experience this across different operating systems (macOS, Windows).

**Related Issues:**
- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time
- [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804): Unable to generate Workstream Summary
- [#803](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/803): it doesnt stop selecting, it seems like "shift" or "mouse 1" is locked


## Recommendations
- Investigate and address the LTM performance degradation issue. This appears to be the most common and impactful problem affecting users across different operating systems.
- Fix the "Clear LTM Data" button functionality.  A functioning clear button may provide users with a temporary workaround while the main LTM performance issue is being addressed.
- Look into the issue with workstream summary generation failures. While less frequent than the LTM problem, it still impacts users and hinders their workflow.
- Investigate the selection bug where the application behaves as if "shift" or "mouse 1" is locked. This significantly impacts usability and requires immediate attention.
