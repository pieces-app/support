## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Issues with selection, dependencies, and authentication
Users report persistent selection issues, including unintended selection with arrow keys and mouse clicks, preventing copy-pasting.  Additionally, the "Ensure core dependencies" step fails during installation on Linux. Authentication problems also arise, with users unable to access pro features despite purchasing a membership.  Troubleshooting steps include checking system settings, reinstalling the application, and verifying account status.

- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension

### 2. Pieces software incompatibility issues across platforms
Users are experiencing incompatibility problems with Pieces software components, including the Raycast extension on macOS (v1.100.3), core dependencies on Linux (Pieces OS 4.3.1), and authentication issues on Windows (Pieces OS 12.1.1).  The Raycast extension triggers update errors, the Linux setup encounters a "Retry Step" message during dependency checks, and Windows users face authentication failures impacting Pro membership access.  Solutions may involve updating the Raycast extension, troubleshooting dependency installation, and verifying login credentials/connectivity.

### 3. Authentication flow errors in Pieces OS
Users are experiencing authentication issues across different Pieces OS versions and platforms (Windows, Linux).  Problems include "An error occurred in the authentication flow" message with an error ID, and issues with the "Ensure core dependencies" step.  Suggested solutions include checking firewall settings, trying different browsers, reinstalling the application, and verifying account status.

- [#809](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/809): Ensure core dependencies; Retry Step

### 4. Pieces OS and App Integration Issues
Users report problems with Pieces OS and app integration, including MCP server SSE connection hangs in Claude Code, LTM performance degradation over time, and "Ensure core dependencies" step failing during setup.  Suggested solutions include checking MCP server configuration, clearing LTM data (if possible), and reinstalling or updating Pieces OS and app.

### 5. Users unable to access Pieces Pro features despite paid subscription
Multiple users report being unable to use Pieces Pro features, receiving messages prompting them to upgrade despite having a paid subscription.  Issues include authentication problems and errors when querying LTM.  This affects various operating systems (macOS, Windows) and Pieces OS versions (12.1.1).  Troubleshooting steps like logging out and back in have not resolved the issue. Further investigation into authentication and Pro access mechanisms is needed.

**Related Issues:**
- [#811](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/811): I'm sorry. This feature requires Pieces Pro. Please upgrade your plan or change your LLM to continue.
- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension
- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time


## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving authentication issues across Pieces OS and related applications (Windows, Linux, macOS).  This includes investigating "An error occurred in the authentication flow" and Pro access problems despite paid subscriptions.
- Address Pieces OS and app integration problems, focusing on MCP server SSE connection hangs in Claude Code and LTM performance degradation. Check MCP server configuration and explore options for clearing LTM data.
- Investigate and fix the "Ensure core dependencies" step failure during Pieces OS installation on Linux.
- Resolve the selection bug in Pieces OS for Windows where the application behaves as if "shift" or "mouse 1" is locked.
- Update the Raycast extension to ensure compatibility with the latest Raycast version (1.100.3) on macOS.
- Look into reports of users being unable to generate Workstream Summaries and the "Clear LTM Data" button not functioning correctly.
