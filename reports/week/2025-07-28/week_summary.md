## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication and Selection Issues in Pieces OS
Users are experiencing authentication errors with new installs and difficulty logging in after purchasing pro.  Additionally,  a bug causes continuous selection, as if shift or mouse 1 is stuck.  Suggested solutions include checking firewall settings, browser extensions, and Pieces logs. Reinstalling the app may also help.

### 2. Pieces OS and extensions issues
Users are experiencing various issues with Pieces OS and its extensions, including Raycast extension incompatibility, authentication failures, and subscription upgrade problems.  The Raycast extension requires an update for compatibility with Raycast 1.100.3.  Authentication issues prevent Pro users from accessing their memberships.  Subscription upgrades fail due to an unresponsive checkout page.  Solutions include updating the Raycast extension, checking authentication credentials, and investigating the checkout process.

- [#808](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/808): Unable to upgrade subscription

### 3. Subscription and Authentication Issues
Users are experiencing difficulty upgrading subscriptions and authenticating their Pro accounts.  The upgrade process leads to a blank checkout page with zero values, eventually failing.  Authentication attempts are unsuccessful, preventing Pro users from accessing features.  This affects both macOS and Windows users on Pieces OS 12.1.1.

**Related Issues:**

- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension
- [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804): Unable to generate Workstream Summary

### 4. LTM performance degrades over time, becomes unresponsive
Users report that the Long Term Memory (LTM) functionality slows down and eventually stops returning results after several weeks of use.  The issue occurs on both desktop and via MCP. Clearing LTM data is unsuccessful.  The problem seems related to the volume of data stored in the LTM. Reinstalling or removing all Pieces data temporarily resolves the issue.

**Related Issues:**
- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time
- [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804): Unable to generate Workstream Summary
- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension


## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving authentication issues across Pieces OS, Desktop application, and extensions. This appears to be blocking Pro users and new installs.
- Investigate and fix the persistent selection bug in the Desktop Application on Windows.  This significantly impacts usability.
- Address the Raycast extension incompatibility with Raycast 1.100.3. Release an updated extension.
- Troubleshoot and resolve the subscription upgrade process failure.  The blank checkout page indicates a critical error in the payment flow.
- Investigate and address the Long Term Memory (LTM) performance degradation.  Determine the cause of the slowdown and implement a solution to maintain optimal LTM functionality.
