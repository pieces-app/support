## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Issues with selection, dependencies, and authentication
Users reported persistent selection issues, including unintended selection with arrow keys and mouse clicks, preventing copy-pasting.  Other reported issues include failure of the "Ensure core dependencies" step during installation and unsuccessful authentication despite purchasing Pieces OS Pro.  Suggested solutions include checking system dependencies, reinstalling the application, and verifying account credentials.

- [#809](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/809): Ensure core dependencies; Retry Step
- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension

### 2. Pieces OS fails to initialize due to missing platform directory
Users on Windows and Linux encounter "MissingPlatformDirectoryException" during initialization, specifically when determining the database location.  The "Ensure core dependencies" or OS boot process fails.  Suggested solutions include restarting the machine and checking data directory permissions. If the issue persists, contact support.

- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
- [#809](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/809): Ensure core dependencies; Retry Step

### 3. Pieces software incompatibility issues across platforms
Users are experiencing incompatibility issues with Pieces software components, including the Raycast extension on macOS (v1.100.3), core dependencies on Linux (Pieces OS 4.3.1), and authentication problems on Windows (Pieces OS 12.1.1).  The Raycast extension triggers update errors, the Linux setup encounters a "Retry Step" message during dependency checks, and Windows users face authentication failures impacting Pro membership access.  Suggested solutions include updating the Raycast extension, verifying core dependencies on Linux, and troubleshooting authentication issues on Windows, potentially involving account re-authentication or support assistance.

- [#809](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/809): Ensure core dependencies; Retry Step
- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension

### 4. Subscription and Authentication Issues
Users are experiencing difficulty upgrading subscriptions and authenticating their Pro accounts.  Upgrade attempts result in a blank checkout page with zero values, eventually failing.  Authentication issues prevent Pro users from accessing their memberships.  This affects both macOS and Windows users on Pieces OS 12.1.1. Further investigation into checkout and authentication processes is needed.

**Related Issues:**
- [#808](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/808): Unable to upgrade subscription
- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension
- [#812](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/812): Unable to generate Workstream Summary

### 5. Pieces OS and Desktop App Integration Issues
Users report problems with Pieces OS integration with other applications, like Claude Code in VS Code, and general LTM functionality. Issues include SSE connection hangs, LTM performance degradation over time, and "Ensure core dependencies" step failing during setup.  Suggested solutions include checking MCP server configuration, clearing LTM data (though the button is reported broken), and reinstalling/reinitializing Pieces OS and the Desktop app.

**Related Issues:**
- [#810](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/810): MCP Server SSE Connection Hangs - No Tools Available in Claude Code
- [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805): LTM gets gunged up over time
- [#809](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/809): Ensure core dependencies; Retry Step


## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the "Pieces OS: Issues with selection, dependencies, and authentication" common issue, focusing on selection bugs, dependency installation failures, and authentication problems.
- Address the "Pieces OS fails to initialize due to missing platform directory" error on Windows and Linux by investigating data directory permissions and providing clearer instructions for users encountering this issue.
- Investigate and resolve the incompatibility issues between Pieces software components, specifically the Raycast extension update errors on macOS, core dependency issues on Linux, and authentication failures on Windows.
- Resolve the subscription upgrade issue causing a blank checkout page and zero values, and ensure Pro users can successfully authenticate and access their memberships.
