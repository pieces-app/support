## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Issues with selection, dependencies, and authentication
Users report persistent selection issues, including unintended selection with arrow keys and mouse clicks, preventing copy-pasting.  Additionally, the "Ensure core dependencies" step fails during installation on Linux.  Authentication problems also arise, with users unable to access Pro features despite purchasing memberships.  Troubleshooting steps include checking system dependencies, reinstalling the app, and verifying account status.

- [#809](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/809): Ensure core dependencies; Retry Step
- [#807](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/807): Authentication via Web Extension

### 2. Pieces software incompatibility issues across platforms
Users are experiencing incompatibility issues with Pieces software, including the Raycast extension on macOS (v1.100.3), core dependencies on Linux (v4.3.1), and authentication problems on Windows (v12.1.1).  The Raycast extension triggers an update error, Linux setup stalls at "Ensure core dependencies," and Windows users struggle with Pro account authentication.  Check for software updates and ensure system compatibility.

### 3. Authentication Errors in Pieces OS Desktop App
Users are experiencing authentication errors when attempting to sign in to the Pieces OS desktop app across different operating systems (Windows, Linux).  Issues range from new installs failing initial authentication to existing users unable to re-authenticate.  Suggested troubleshooting includes checking firewall settings, trying different browsers, and reinstalling the application.

### 4. Pieces OS and App Integration Issues
Users report problems with Pieces OS and app integration, including MCP server SSE connection hangs in Claude Code, LTM performance degradation over time, and "Ensure core dependencies" step failing during setup.  Suggested solutions include checking MCP server configuration, clearing LTM data (if possible), and reinstalling or updating Pieces OS and app.

### 5. Users unable to access Pieces Pro features despite paid subscription
Multiple users report being unable to use Pieces Pro features, receiving messages prompting them to upgrade despite having a paid subscription.  Issues include authentication problems and errors related to LLM queries.  This affects various operating systems and Pieces OS versions.  Troubleshooting steps such as logging out and back in have not resolved the issue. Further investigation into authentication and Pro access mechanisms is needed.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the "Pieces OS: Issues with selection, dependencies, and authentication" common issue, focusing on selection bugs, Linux dependency failures, and authentication problems.
- Address the "Pieces software incompatibility issues across platforms" by updating the Raycast extension, resolving Linux core dependency issues, and fixing Windows authentication errors.
- Investigate and resolve the root cause of authentication errors across different operating systems to improve user onboarding and access.
- Address the "Users unable to access Pieces Pro features despite paid subscription" issue to ensure paying users can utilize the features they've purchased.
- Improve LTM performance and stability by addressing the issue of it becoming unresponsive over time and fixing the "Clear LTM Data" function.
- Investigate and resolve the MCP server SSE connection hangs to ensure proper integration with Claude Code in VS Code.
- Improve the Pieces OS and app setup process by addressing the recurring "Ensure core dependencies" failure on Linux.
