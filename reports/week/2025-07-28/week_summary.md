## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication and Selection Issues in Pieces OS
Users reported issues with authentication flows, receiving error messages upon signing in. Another common issue involved unintended selection behavior, possibly due to stuck keys or mouse clicks.  Suggested solutions include checking firewall settings, browser extensions, and Pieces logs. Reinstallation did not resolve the authentication issue for some users.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
- [#803](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/803): it doesnt stop selecting, it seems like "shift" or "mouse 1" is locked
- [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804): Unable to generate Workstream Summary

### 2. Pieces OS and extensions incompatibility issues
Users report incompatibility between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  The Raycast extension triggers errors in recent Raycast versions, while the core Pieces app experiences LTM query failures after prolonged use. Clearing LTM data is ineffective.  Users suggest updating the Raycast extension for compatibility and addressing LTM performance issues.
