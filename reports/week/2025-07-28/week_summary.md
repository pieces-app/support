### 2. Pieces OS and extensions incompatibility issues
Users report incompatibility between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  The Raycast extension triggers errors in recent Raycast versions, while the core Pieces app experiences LTM query failures after prolonged use. Clearing LTM data is ineffective.  Users suggest updating the Raycast extension and addressing LTM performance issues.
