## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication and Selection Issues in Pieces OS
Users reported issues with authentication flows, receiving error messages upon signing in. Another common issue involved unintended selection behavior, possibly due to stuck keys or mouse clicks.  Suggested solutions include checking browser extensions, firewall settings, and Pieces logs. Reinstallation and trying different browsers may also help.

**Related Issues:**

- [#804](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/804): Unable to generate Workstream Summary

### 2. Pieces OS and extensions incompatibility issues
Users report incompatibility between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  The Raycast extension triggers errors in recent Raycast versions.  Additionally, the LTM functionality degrades over time, becoming unresponsive and requiring data clearing to function again.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional.

- Resolve the LTM performance degradation issue (#805) and the non-functional "Clear LTM Data" button to ensure long-term usability on macOS.
- Look into the issue regarding Workstream Summary generation failure (#804) on Windows.
