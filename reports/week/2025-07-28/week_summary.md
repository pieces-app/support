## Common Issues
### 1. LTM performance degrades over time, becomes unresponsive
Users report that the Long Term Memory (LTM) functionality slows down and eventually stops returning results after several weeks of use.  Clearing LTM data sometimes resolves the issue temporarily.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional. This affects both desktop application and MCP access.  Users experience performance issues with large amounts of saved data.

**Related Issues:**

## Recommendations
- Investigate and address the LTM performance degradation issue. This appears to be the most common and impactful problem affecting users.
- Fix the "Clear LTM Data" button functionality.
- Investigate the issue with Workstream Summary generation failure.
- Look into the selection bug where the application seems to get stuck in selection mode.
- Prioritize bug fixes for the desktop application, specifically on macOS and Windows operating systems.
