## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS: Issues with Selection, Dependencies, and Authentication
Users report persistent selection issues, including unintended selection with arrow keys and mouse clicks, preventing copy-pasting.  Additionally, the "Ensure core dependencies" step fails during installation on Linux.  Authentication problems also arise, with users unable to access Pro features despite purchasing memberships. Troubleshooting steps include checking system settings, reinstalling the application, and verifying account credentials.

### 2. Pieces software incompatibility issues across platforms
Users are experiencing incompatibility issues with Pieces software components, including the Raycast extension, across macOS, Linux, and Windows.  The Raycast extension is not compatible with recent Raycast versions, causing errors. On Linux, the "Ensure core dependencies" step fails during setup.  Windows users are facing authentication problems, hindering Pro membership access.  Suggested solutions include updating the Raycast extension, troubleshooting dependencies on Linux, and verifying login credentials on Windows.

Users are experiencing authentication errors when attempting to sign in to the Pieces OS desktop app across different operating systems (Windows, Linux).  Issues range from new user sign-in failures to problems with existing Pro accounts.  Suggested troubleshooting includes checking firewall settings, trying different browsers, and ensuring core dependencies are met during installation.
