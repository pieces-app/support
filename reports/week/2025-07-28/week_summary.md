## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication and Selection Issues in Pieces OS on Windows
Users are experiencing authentication errors with new Pieces installations on Windows, receiving error ID 00000000000000000000000000000000.  Additionally, there are reports of unintended selection behavior, as if the Shift key or mouse button is stuck.  Troubleshooting steps include checking browser extensions, switching default browsers, and reinstalling Pieces. Further investigation is needed for both issues.

### 2. Pieces OS and extensions incompatibility issues
Users report incompatibility between Pieces OS extensions (Raycast) and the Pieces desktop application.  The Raycast extension triggers errors in recent Raycast versions.  Additionally, the LTM functionality within Pieces OS becomes unresponsive after prolonged use, requiring data clearing to restore functionality. The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional.

- Address the unintended selection behavior in Pieces OS on Windows, simulating stuck Shift key or mouse button scenarios to identify the root cause.
- Prioritize updating the Pieces Raycast extension for compatibility with recent Raycast versions, addressing the reported error messages.
- Investigate and resolve the LTM unresponsiveness issue within Pieces OS after prolonged use, including verifying the functionality of the "Clear LTM Data" button.
- Improve the authentication flow within Pieces to provide more informative error messages and troubleshooting steps for users.
