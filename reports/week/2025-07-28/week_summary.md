## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication and Selection Issues in Pieces OS for Windows
Users are experiencing authentication errors with new Pieces installations on Windows, receiving error ID 00000000000000000000000000000000.  Additionally, there are reports of unintended selection behavior, possibly related to stuck Shift or Mouse 1 input.  Troubleshooting steps include browser changes, reinstallation, and firewall checks. Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and solutions.

### 2. Pieces OS and Raycast extension incompatibility issues
Users report the Pieces Raycast extension is incompatible with recent Raycast versions, causing errors.  Additionally, the Pieces LTM becomes unresponsive after extended use, requiring data deletion to function again. The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional.

## Recommendations
- Investigate authentication error ID 00000000000000000000000000000000 on Windows and unintended selection behavior. Check for stuck Shift/Mouse 1 input.
- Address Raycast extension incompatibility with recent Raycast versions and the unresponsive LTM issue after extended use.  Fix "Clear LTM Data" button.
- Prioritize resolution of issues affecting Windows users, given the higher frequency.
- Improve LTM performance and stability, especially for long-term use. Explore data management strategies to prevent "gunging up."
- Review logs and gather more data on the "Unable to generate Workstream Summary" error (ApiException 500).
