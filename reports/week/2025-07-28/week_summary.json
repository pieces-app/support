Same issue occurs whether using Claude Code in terminal or integrated with VS Code\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- SSE endpoint (http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse) responds with:\n\n```\nevent: endpoint\ndata: /model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages\n```\n\n- Connection then hangs indefinitely (SSE buffering issue)\n- Both Pieces OS and Pieces app processes are running\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
