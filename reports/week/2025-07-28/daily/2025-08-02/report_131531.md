## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Pro Access and MCP Integration Issues
Users are experiencing issues with Pieces Pro access, even with paid subscriptions, resulting in errors when querying.  Additionally, the MCP server connection hangs when integrating with Claude Code in VS Code, preventing tool registration.  This affects both standalone CLI and VS Code integration.  Check Pieces configuration and ensure proper communication between Pieces and Claude Code.
