## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS fails to launch on Windows due to data directory issues
Multiple support tickets report Pieces OS failing to start on Windows machines. Logs consistently show "MissingPlatformDirectoryException(Unable to get application documents directory)" error.  This suggests an issue locating or accessing the user's application data directory.  Potential solutions include checking file permissions, reinstalling the application, or ensuring the required Windows directories exist.

- [#812](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/812): Unable to generate Workstream Summary


## Recommendations
- Investigate the "MissingPlatformDirectoryException" error on Windows. Check file permissions, default Windows directories, and consider adding clearer error messaging or troubleshooting steps in the application.
- Address the issue preventing Workstream Summary generation. Review the error message related to the application being in local mode and the suggested 'applications/update/capabilities' update call.
- Prioritize resolution of issues affecting core application launch and Workstream Summary generation, as these impact all users on Windows.
