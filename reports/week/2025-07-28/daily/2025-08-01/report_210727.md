## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces integrations failing due to version incompatibility
Users are experiencing issues with Pieces integrations (Raycast extension, core dependencies) due to version incompatibility.  The Raycast extension is not compatible with recent Raycast versions (e.g., 1.100.3), and core dependencies are failing to initialize on Linux (Pieces OS 4.3.1). Users are advised to check for updates for both Pieces and the related integrations (Raycast).
