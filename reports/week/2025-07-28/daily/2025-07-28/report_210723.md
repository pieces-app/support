## Common Issues
### 1. LTM performance degrades over time, becomes unresponsive
Users report that the Long Term Memory (LTM) functionality slows down and eventually stops returning results after several weeks of use.  Clearing LTM data sometimes resolves the issue temporarily.  The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional. This affects both desktop application and MCP access.  Users experience long query times and null results. Reinstalling or clearing all Pieces data provides a temporary fix.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and address the LTM performance degradation issue. This appears to be the most common and impactful problem affecting users.
- Improve the "Clear LTM Data" functionality as it's currently reported as non-functional.
- Look into the issue with selection getting stuck, as reported in ticket #803. This has a high activity level and impacts usability.
- Investigate the "Unable to generate Workstream Summary" error (ticket #804) to ensure this core feature is working as expected.
