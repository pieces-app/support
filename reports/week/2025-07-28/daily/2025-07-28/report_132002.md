## Common Issues
### 1. LTM performance degrades over time, becomes unresponsive
Users report that the Long Term Memory (LTM) functionality slows down and eventually stops returning results after several weeks of use.  Clearing LTM data sometimes resolves the issue, but the problem reoccurs. The "Clear LTM Data" button is also reported as non-functional. This affects both desktop application and MCP access.  Users experience long query times and null results, impacting workflow.
