## Common Issues
### 1. Issues with Pieces OS Upgrade, Authentication, and Installation
Users are experiencing problems with upgrading to Pieces OS Pro, authenticating their accounts after purchase, and completing the installation process.  Upgrade attempts result in a blank checkout page. Authentication issues prevent Pro users from accessing their memberships.  Installation issues include the "Ensure core dependencies" step failing and requiring retry.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions for these issues across different operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux).

### 2. Pieces OS: Issues with selection, dependencies, and authentication
Users report persistent selection issues, including unintended selection with arrow keys and mouse clicks, preventing copy-pasting.  Additionally, the "Ensure core dependencies" step fails during installation on Linux.  Authentication problems also arise, with users unable to access Pro features despite purchasing memberships. Troubleshooting steps include checking system settings, reinstalling the application, and verifying account status.

### 3. Pieces software incompatibility issues across platforms
Users are experiencing incompatibility issues with Pieces software, including the Raycast extension on macOS (v1.100.3), core dependencies on Linux (v4.3.1), and authentication problems on Windows (v12.1.1).  The Raycast extension triggers an update error, Linux setup stalls at "Ensure core dependencies," and Windows users are unable to authenticate despite having Pro memberships.  Suggested solutions include updating the Raycast extension, checking dependencies on Linux, and verifying login credentials on Windows.
