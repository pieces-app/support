The exact cause of the LTM flow issue needs further investigation. However, the user can currently prevent crashes by keeping the Long-Term Memory engine turned off.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key points raised:**\n\n* Johnkennyuk is having trouble linking his GitHub and Google accounts to Pieces.\n* The current account linking system is not working properly and is due to be replaced.\n* The issue appears to be caused by a case sensitivity issue between the registered email addresses.\n\n**Problems identified:**\n\n* Unable to link GitHub and Google accounts.\n* Case sensitivity issue causing linking failure.\n* Outdated authentication service causing minor issues.\n\n**Solutions proposed/implemented:**\n\n* Merge accounts using Google account as the main account.\n* User to sign out and back in with Google account.\n* Possible need to reset GitHub account.\n* Temporary disablement of email privacy setting on GitHub.\n* New authentication system will be released in March 2025.\n\n**Current status/outcome:**\n\n* New authentication system is currently under development and expected to be released in early/mid March 2025.\n* User will be notified when the new system is available and offered to participate in early testing.\n* Johnkennyuk will wait for the new system to be released and then attempt to link his accounts again.",
