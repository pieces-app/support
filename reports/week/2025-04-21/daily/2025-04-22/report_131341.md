## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Crashes and Account Linking Issues
Users reported crashes due to native_extensions_plugin.dll, particularly impacting the Long-Term Memory (LTM) feature. Disabling LTM mitigates crashes.  Account linking issues prevent simultaneous Google and GitHub integration, likely due to email case sensitivity. A new authentication system is planned for March 2025 to resolve this.
