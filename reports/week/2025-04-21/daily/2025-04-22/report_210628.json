Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation:\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* Initial issue: User (@johnkennyuk) is unable to link their personal domain and Google account due to an old, buggy authentication flow.\n* Proposed solutions: \n    * Temporary fix by merging accounts and making Google account the main one.\n    * Permanent fix with a new authentication service.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* Existing linking flow was not straightforward and prone to bugs.\n* Possible issue with email capitalization causing the linking failure.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Temporary: Merged accounts and made Google account the main one.\n* Permanent: New authentication service is under development.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* Temporary fix is implemented, but user is waiting for the new authentication service.\n* New service is still under development and release date is pushed to early/mid March.\n* Issue will be re-addressed when the new service is available.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* New authentication service is expected to allow linking of even more account types.\n* User is encouraged to schedule a call with support for further assistance.\n\n**Overall:** The user's immediate issue was resolved with a temporary fix, but a permanent solution is in the works and will be available soon.",
