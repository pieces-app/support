I've been using LTM 2 since launch without clearing it. Such an improvement over LTM 1 with regards to time to first token. However, I have started to feel that ttft was getting longerand longer, even on supposedly faster LLMs. Even if built to recall 9 months worth of data, it might not be optimal, which is fair. Note that I have edited both the list of apps allowed to provide context, as well as checked apps to get context from within a chat. But to no improvement. So I tried tp clear the all time LTM. On Pieces Desktop, I do not get feedback when I click the clear button, but the dialog box disappears after a while. It takes some time. When checking if LTM has been cleared by asking a question about what I did in the morning or last week, the copilot would answer it correctly.  I conclude the LTM has not been cleared. I deleted the chat and tried to clear it via Pieces OS, got direct click feedback and after a while a confirmation message. Retried the copilot and it still has context. I suppose this is not expected behavior. By the way, using clouds LLMs.\n\nAny ideas?\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
