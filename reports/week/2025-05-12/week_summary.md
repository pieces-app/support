## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and Desktop App Performance and Login Issues
Users report performance issues with Pieces OS and Desktop App on macOS, including slowdowns and high CPU/GPU usage.  Additionally, login issues are reported on Linux with HTTP 500 errors. Clearing LTM doesn't resolve performance problems.  Further investigation is needed into resource utilization and login failures.
