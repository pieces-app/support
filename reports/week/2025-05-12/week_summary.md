## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS login and connectivity issues
Users are experiencing login failures, slow performance, and "unable to reach cloud services" errors across Windows and Linux on various Pieces OS versions.  Common symptoms include HTTP 500 errors on /os/sign_in, indefinite loading spinners, and error messages in the AI chat.  Troubleshooting steps include checking internet connectivity, switching networks, and restarting Pieces OS. Further investigation into server-side issues and potential bugs related to updates is needed.

### 2. Pieces Desktop App Performance Issues and Connectivity Problems
Users report slow performance, unresponsiveness, and "unable to reach cloud services" errors in the Pieces desktop app. Issues appear across Windows and macOS, potentially related to recent updates or local network connectivity.

Additionally, performance issues are reported, including slow response times and high CPU/GPU usage, especially on older MacBooks. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and potential solutions for both LTM clearing and performance issues.
