| [#709](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/709) | LTM does not clear | 4.42 |

## Common Issues
### 1. LTM not clearing on Pieces OS Desktop and Pieces OS
Users report LTM not clearing despite clicking the clear button in Pieces OS Desktop and Pieces OS.  No feedback is provided on Desktop, while OS shows a confirmation. However, the copilot retains context from previous interactions. This issue affects cloud LLMs and persists even after re-checking context app permissions and deleting chats.  Users observe increased time to first token, suggesting LTM might not be clearing as expected.
