## Common Issues
### 1. Login and Navigation Issues in Desktop Applications
Users are experiencing problems with login functionality and navigation within Pieces OS and the Pieces VS Code extension.  One user reported being unable to sign in, while another found that Home/End keys don't navigate within text fields as expected in the VS Code extension, unlike in similar extensions.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving login issues in the desktop application to ensure user access.
- Investigate and address the navigation bug within the VS Code extension's text fields, specifically the unexpected behavior of Home/End keys.
- Consider improving the sign-in process to provide clearer error messages and guidance to users.
- Review the VS Code extension's keybindings to ensure compatibility with standard navigation shortcuts and prevent conflicts with other extensions.
