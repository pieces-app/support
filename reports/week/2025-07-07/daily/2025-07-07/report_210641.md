## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the WebSocketException causing Pieces Core Services to fail to open. This issue is affecting multiple users across different operating systems and is hindering core functionality.
- Address the Pieces macOS app and Raycast extension update issues. Users are unable to update the app or use the extension due to compatibility problems and update loops.
- Investigate the authentication flow error on new Pieces installations.  This is blocking new users from accessing the platform and requires immediate attention.
- Improve the Pieces Desktop App update process on macOS. Address issues with workstream activity updates, app update failures, and long dependency verification times.
- Monitor and address the "Unable to open Pieces Copilot Service" error. While less frequent, it still impacts user experience.
