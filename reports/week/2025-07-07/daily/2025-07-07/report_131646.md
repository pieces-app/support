## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Raycast Extension Incompatibility
Users are experiencing incompatibility issues with the Pieces Raycast extension and recent Raycast versions (1.100.3+).  The extension triggers an update error message.  This might be related to Pieces OS and its core services, as some users report websocket connection failures and issues with Pieces Copilot.  Check for Pieces OS and extension updates.

### 2. Pieces Core Services Fails to Open Due to WebSocket Error
