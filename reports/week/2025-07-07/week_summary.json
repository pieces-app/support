After installing, creating an account, etc. I started UltraEdit and was looking forward to the integration. What I was met with was a window that said that Pieces isn't running with an error unable to determine Pieces connection port. After some discussion, UltraEdit team said that I was likely missing the file %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\com.pieces.os\\production\\Config\\.port.txt\nTurns out I'm missing the directory com.pieces.os. I has not been created. I uninstalled all the Pieces apps and reinstalled from the website, hoping that this directory would be created. Now UltraEdit says Pieces for Developers is not installed and prompts me to Download Pieces. Clicking that link takes me directly to the page I just downloaded from.\nI suggested to UltraEdit support that I could recreate the directory structure and add .port.txt, but they said instead that I should contact you. While you are looking at this, I am going to do a complete uninstall of UltraEdit and Pieces components, deleting any registry keys I can find (as uninstall doesn't remove any), and remove the .pieces_identites folder from Documents, then do a complete reinstall.\nLooking forward to a solution to this.\nRegards,\nIan Hannah\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
