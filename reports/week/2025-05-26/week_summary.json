      "description": "Users report issues with Pieces Desktop related to LTM (Long Term Memory) feature. These include incorrect date/time displayed in context, Copilot generating unrelated content despite context, application crashes or freezes, especially on macOS and Windows.  Issues seem to occur after periods of inactivity or when LTM is enabled.  Updating to the latest Pieces OS version might resolve some of these problems. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact causes and solutions.",

I asked it to generate some quiz questions based on what I studied, and it started talking about a lot of unrelated topics, even when the context was provided. Though when I started a new chat based on the context again and became more specific with the details such as lecture name and number (that was the one and only thing in the context I started the conversation with), it did it correctly. Also, all this while, the context time showed Last Thursday so I think there is an UI bug too. \n\n**Context Image:**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab732ff6-d195-4e81-a2af-6cee1e1d2032)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it talks about unrelated topics):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6abd44-60a0-4f0c-9f8a-1cf1a887fd2e)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it was fixed):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d86c81-ba0e-4ec3-8e2f-49a326ac232a)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
