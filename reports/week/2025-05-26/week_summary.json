    "Prioritize resolving the Discord invite link issue across all platforms (website, documentation, Pieces OS).  This is a recurring problem affecting multiple users.",
    "Investigate and address the performance issues (freezing, high resource usage) reported for Pieces Desktop on both Windows and macOS. Focus on resource management and potential memory leaks, especially after chat usage and with LTM enabled.",
    "Improve VS Code extension stability and resolve the infinite loading issue with the copy button.  Also, investigate WSL connectivity problems on Windows.",
    "Address the reported Pieces Desktop crashes when Chrome tabs contain large amounts of content. This may indicate memory or resource management issues within the Pieces Desktop application itself.",
    "Review and update the support documentation with troubleshooting steps for common issues like WSL connectivity, VS Code integration, and performance problems.  This will empower users to self-resolve and reduce support ticket volume.",
    "Consider adding more robust error logging and reporting within Pieces Desktop and its integrations to facilitate faster debugging and resolution of issues.",
    "Monitor user feedback closely for emerging trends and prioritize addressing the most frequent and impactful issues to improve overall user experience and satisfaction.",
    "Proactively communicate known issues and planned fixes to the user community through a dedicated channel (e.g., status page, forum) to manage expectations and reduce support inquiries.",
    "Analyze the relationship between Pieces OS versions and reported issues to identify potential regressions and prioritize fixes for affected versions.",
    "Implement automated testing to catch common issues like broken links and basic functionality before they reach users, reducing the need for reactive support interventions. "
