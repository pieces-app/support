I checked for any updates I may have missed, and none. I restarted the software by forcing it to quit, but the issue persisted. \n\nThe issue only happens when I turn on L.T.M. \nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

I would interact with it in a chat, go back to working in another app and after a while go back to Desktop to find it had frozen. Restart of Pieces Desktop is needed. Note that this problem is very frequent since latest update on May 22nd, but not systematic. I had also noticed this kind of behavior before the updated but put it on the count of my Hardware, Intel i5, 16Gbram Asus Vivobook, but I think I can dismiss this theory.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is that this behavior seems to only happen if I had, prior to returning to Pieces Desktop, interacted with a chat. In cases where I simply had started Desktop, worked on something else and gone back to Desktop, it would keep working properly.\n\nNoteworthy: LTM is enabled by default for all chats. Default LLM: Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
