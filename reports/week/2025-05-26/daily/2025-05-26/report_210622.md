## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Links and Pieces Crashing with Large Content
Users report invalid Discord links across the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  A separate issue involves Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers crashing on Windows when Chrome tabs contain large amounts of content, such as extensive logs.  The crashes consume significant resources and sometimes freeze Chrome entirely, impacting users with 16GB RAM and 12 vCPUs. No relevant logs are found in the Support directory.

### 2. Invalid or incorrect links and icons
Multiple issues reported regarding incorrect icons and broken links. Sublime Text plugin uses the wrong icon in the Connected Applications menu.
