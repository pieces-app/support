## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Link and Incorrect Icon
Multiple Pieces platforms (website, app, documentation) have invalid Discord invite links.  A consistent, non-expiring link should replace current links. Additionally, the Sublime Text plugin icon in the Connected Applications menu is incorrectly displaying the Pieces icon and should be updated with the Sublime Text 4 icon.
