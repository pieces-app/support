## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Copilot Inaccuracy and UI Bug with LTM
Pieces Copilot inaccurately generates information when using the 'Start Copilot Chat' button in Workstream Activity view, sometimes pulling in unrelated topics even with provided context.  A UI bug also displays an incorrect date and time (Last Thursday) for the context. Specifying details like lecture name and number can improve accuracy.  The issue appears related to LTM (Long-Term Memory) functionality not being properly integrated with Copilot.
