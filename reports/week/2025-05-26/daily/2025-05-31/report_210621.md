## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Copilot Inaccuracy and UI Bug with LTM
Pieces Copilot inaccurately generates information when using LTM, potentially due to incorrect date/time context.  Users report unrelated topics in initial responses. Specifying context details, like lecture names, improves accuracy.  A UI bug displays "Last Thursday" as the context time, regardless of the actual time.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Pieces Copilot LTM inaccuracy and UI bug as it has the highest frequency and activity level.
- Investigate the root cause of the Pieces Copilot issue, including date/time context handling and the "Last Thursday" UI bug.
- Review and update documentation or user guides regarding Pieces Copilot LTM usage to address the confusion around context specification.
- Consider implementing input validation or clearer prompts for context details in the Pieces Copilot interface.
- Monitor the impact of these fixes on support ticket volume and user satisfaction related to Pieces Copilot and LTM functionality.
- While less frequent, address the remote desktop issue with the Pieces extension in WSL to improve the user experience on that platform as well
