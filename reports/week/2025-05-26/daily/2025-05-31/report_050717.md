## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Copilot Inaccuracy and UI Bug with LTM
Pieces Copilot inaccurately generates information when using LTM, potentially due to incorrect date/time context.  Users report unrelated topics in initial responses, even with provided context. Specifying details like lecture name improves accuracy.  A UI bug displays "Last Thursday" as the context time, regardless of actual LTM usage.
