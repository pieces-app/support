Piesces Setting window is empty, but earlier it showed two buttons Launch and Install and when you click on Install, for example, VS Code shows notification that it can't connect to Pieces OS. I tried multiple fixes I found. One is to set Custom URL for Remote environment and I tried with <Windows IP>:1000 and with NGrok forwarding of same url, both without success and I could reach both with curl. There are some errors in VS Code Developer tools related to Pieces OS extension:\n\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: version is longer than 256 characters\nat new it (settingsView.js:1:5120)\nat UH (settingsView.js:1:9927)\nat Object.tU (settingsView.js:1:10530)\nat vN (settingsView.js:19:354749)\n\nat\nhttps://vscode-remote+wsl-002bubuntu.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/home/vladan/.vscode-server/extensions/meshintelligenttechnologiesinc.pieces-vscode-2.0.6/dist/settingsView.js\n\nand Pieces OS log shows error:\n\nGET     [404] /assets/stream/identifiers: port:Instance of 'Future<int>': (2nd server)\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

I asked it to generate some quiz questions based on what I studied, and it started talking about a lot of unrelated topics, even when the context was provided. Though when I started a new chat based on the context again and became more specific with the details such as lecture name and number (that was the one and only thing in the context I started the conversation with), it did it correctly. Also, all this while, the context time showed Last Thursday so I think there is an UI bug too. \n\n**Context Image:**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab732ff6-d195-4e81-a2af-6cee1e1d2032)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it talks about unrelated topics):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6abd44-60a0-4f0c-9f8a-1cf1a887fd2e)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it was fixed):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d86c81-ba0e-4ec3-8e2f-49a326ac232a)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
