I asked it to generate some quiz questions based on what I studied, and it started talking about a lot of unrelated topics, even when the context was provided. Though when I started a new chat based on the context again and became more specific with the details such as lecture name and number (that was the one and only thing in the context I started the conversation with), it did it correctly. Also, all this while, the context time showed Last Thursday so I think there is an UI bug too. \n\n**Context Image:**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab732ff6-d195-4e81-a2af-6cee1e1d2032)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it talks about unrelated topics):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6abd44-60a0-4f0c-9f8a-1cf1a887fd2e)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it was fixed):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d86c81-ba0e-4ec3-8e2f-49a326ac232a)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
