## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Performance Issues and Freezes
Users report performance issues, including slowdowns and crashes, primarily on macOS, often associated with LTM 2/2.5.  Symptoms range from high CPU/GPU usage and fan speed to application freezes after inactivity, especially after chat interactions.  Issue frequency increased after recent updates.  Solutions may include disabling LTM, updating Pieces, or further investigation of resource usage.

### 4. Pieces Desktop Issues with LTM
Users report issues with Pieces Desktop related to LTM (Long Term Memory) feature. These include incorrect date/time displayed in context, Copilot generating unrelated content despite provided context, application crashes or freezes, especially after periods of inactivity or when LTM is enabled.  Issues observed across macOS and Windows on Pieces OS 11.4.1/11.4.2 and Pieces Desktop 4.1.3. Further investigation needed to isolate LTM-specific bugs from general performance issues.

### 5. Pieces OS 11.4.2: Slow or failed responses, image pasting issues
Users report slow or no responses to chat prompts, image pasting failures resulting in "Uuups" errors, and GPT-4.1 struggling to process content. These issues occur across the desktop application, VS Code, and Visual Studio on Windows.  A common error message references a missing or inaccessible Gemini Pro model.
