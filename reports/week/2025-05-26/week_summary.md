## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Software Bugs and Invalid Discord Link
Users reported issues with Pieces Desktop application including incorrect LTM information in Copilot chat, freezing after inactivity, and invalid Discord invite links on the website and documentation.  The LTM issue was resolved by providing specific context to Copilot. The freezing issue is intermittent and potentially related to chat interaction.  The Discord links need updating with a non-expiring link.

**Related Issues:**
- [#731](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/731): Pieces Copilot doesn't get the LTM info and shows a wrong date
- [#719](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/719): Pieces Desktop freezes after inactivity
- [#723](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/723): Discord link provided is invalid on the website

### 2. Pieces performance issues and crashes across platforms
Users report performance issues like slowdowns and crashes on macOS and Windows.  On macOS, high CPU/GPU usage is observed with Pieces OS and Desktop App running. On Windows, the desktop app freezes after inactivity, especially after chat interactions or when Chrome tabs with extensive content are open.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root causes and potential solutions.

### 3. Pieces Desktop App Performance Issues on macOS and Windows
Users are experiencing performance issues with the Pieces Desktop app on both macOS and Windows.  On macOS, the app periodically jumps to the main monitor and grabs focus, along with high CPU/GPU usage and system slowdown. On Windows, the app freezes after a period of inactivity, especially after using the chat feature. Reinstalling the app and checking for extra processes may resolve the focus issue.  The freezing issue may be related to Long Term Memory (LTM) and chat usage.

One user experienced GPT 4.1 loading issues, while another noted Desktop freezing after inactivity, especially after chat use.
