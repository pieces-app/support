## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Links and App Crashes with Large Content
Users report invalid Discord links across the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  A separate issue involves Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers crashing on Windows when Chrome tabs contain large amounts of content, such as extensive logs.  The crashes consume significant resources without generating helpful log files.

### 2. Incorrect or Invalid Icons and Discord Links
Multiple issues reported regarding incorrect icons and invalid Discord links across Pieces OS, desktop application, and website.  Sublime plugin uses Pieces icon instead of Sublime Text 4 icon.  Discord invite links on Pieces OS, main website, and support page are invalid.  Resolution requires updating the plugin icon and replacing expired Discord links with permanent ones.

## Recommendations
- Update Discord links across all platforms (website, Pieces OS, documentation) to a permanent link.
- Replace the Pieces icon in the Sublime Text plugin with the correct Sublime Text 4 icon.
- Investigate and address the crashes occurring in Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers on Windows when Chrome tabs contain large amounts of content.
- Improve logging for crashes to provide more helpful information for debugging.
- Consider increasing system resource allocation (RAM, CPU) if crashes are related to resource limitations.
- Regularly check and update all external links to ensure validity and prevent broken links from impacting user experience.
- Prioritize bug fixes related to application crashes to improve stability and user satisfaction.
- Monitor support tickets for recurring issues and address underlying causes to reduce support volume over time.
- Implement a system for tracking and managing known issues to avoid duplicate reports and streamline resolution.
- Communicate updates and resolutions to users through appropriate channels (e.g., release notes, Discord announcements).
