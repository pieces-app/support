## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Bugs and Crashes Across Platforms
Users report crashes and malfunctions in Pieces OS, Pieces for Developers, and VS Code extension. Issues include crashes when Chrome tabs have extensive content (e.g., large logs), infinite loading of the copy button in VS Code, and invalid Discord invite links on the Pieces website.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions.

### 2. Pieces OS: Loading issues and invalid Discord link

### 3. Pieces desktop app bugs across platforms
Users reported issues with the Pieces desktop application on macOS and Windows. On macOS, the app periodically jumps to the main monitor and steals focus. On Windows, the app crashes when a Chrome tab with extensive content is open.  Additionally, an incorrect icon is displayed for the Sublime Text plugin in the Connected Applications menu. Reinstallation may resolve the focus issue on macOS.
