## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Invite Links Across Pieces Platforms
Multiple reports indicate broken Discord invite links on the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  The links provided are either expired or incorrect. A permanent, non-expiring link should be created and updated across all platforms to resolve this.

**Related Issues:**
- [#723](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/723): Discord link provided is invalid on the website
- [#724](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/724): Discord link provided is invalid in Pieces OS
- [#718](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/718): Pieces crash when on Chrome tab with a lot of content

### 2. Chat responses slow or nonexistent, impacting multiple Pieces OS applications
Users report significant delays (up to 5 minutes) or no responses from chat functionality within Pieces OS applications (Desktop, VS Code, VS 2022).  Issue affects various operating systems (Windows) and Pieces OS versions (11.4.2).  One user experienced complete unresponsiveness with GPT 4.1. Further investigation needed to isolate the cause and potential solutions.

- [#729](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/729): No response to chat. It just keeps loading .
- [#732](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/732): Performance Issues in VSCode with Pieces OS Active

### 3. Pieces Desktop Performance Issues and Freezes
Users report performance issues, including slowdowns and crashes, primarily on macOS, often associated with Long Term Memory (LTM) usage.  Additionally, freezing occurs on Windows after inactivity, especially following chat interactions with LTM enabled.  Troubleshooting steps include checking for updates, restarting the application, and monitoring CPU/GPU usage.

### 4. Pieces Desktop Issues with LTM
Users report issues with Pieces Desktop related to LTM, including incorrect date/time display, crashes (macOS), and freezing after inactivity (Windows).  Copilot chat sometimes generates unrelated topics even with context provided. Issues appear across different Pieces OS versions (11.4.1, 11.4.2) and Desktop versions. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and provide solutions.

**Related Issues:**
- [#731](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/731): Pieces Copilot doesn't get the LTM info and shows a wrong date
- [#734](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/734): Pieces Desktop keeps crashing
- [#719](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/719): Pieces Desktop freezes after inactivity

### 5. Pieces Desktop App Crashes/Freezes
Users report Pieces Desktop app crashing or freezing across macOS and Windows. One user noted crashes linked to enabling L.T.M 2.5. Another user reported freezing after inactivity, especially after using chat with LTM enabled. A third user experienced crashes when browsing content-heavy Chrome tabs.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact causes and solutions.

**Related Issues:**
- [#734](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/734): Pieces Desktop keeps crashing
- [#719](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/719): Pieces Desktop freezes after inactivity

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Discord invite link issue across all platforms (website, documentation, Pieces OS) by creating a permanent, non-expiring link.
- Investigate and address the root cause of slow or nonexistent chat responses within Pieces OS applications, including Desktop, VS Code, and VS 2022, across different operating systems and Pieces OS versions.
- Focus on resolving performance issues and crashes/freezes in Pieces Desktop, specifically on macOS (related to LTM usage) and Windows (freezing after inactivity and chat interactions with LTM enabled).
- Investigate and fix the issue with Pieces Copilot chat generating unrelated topics even with context provided, along with the incorrect date/time display in LTM.
- Address the reported Pieces Desktop crashes on macOS linked to enabling L.T.M 2.5 and crashes on Windows when browsing content-heavy Chrome tabs.
- Look into the WSL connectivity issues with Pieces OS in VS Code (ticket #730) and the Sublime Text plugin icon issue (ticket #722).
