## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Invite Links Across Pieces Platforms
Multiple reports indicate invalid Discord invite links on the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  The links provided include discord.gg/getpieces, discord.com/invite/getpieces, and discord.gg/ubn8JFAXQ7.  A consistent solution is to create a single, non-expiring Discord invite link and update all instances across the platforms.
