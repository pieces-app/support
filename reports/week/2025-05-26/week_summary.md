## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the invalid Discord link issue across all platforms (website, Pieces OS, documentation).  This is a recurring problem affecting multiple users.
- Investigate and address the performance issues reported with Pieces OS and Desktop App, particularly focusing on high CPU/GPU usage, freezing, and slowdowns on Windows and macOS.  Check for resource conflicts and potential bugs introduced in the May 22nd update.
- Address the Pieces Copilot issues related to incorrect LTM information and UI bugs displaying wrong dates. Ensure Copilot accurately utilizes context provided by users.
- Look into the reported issues with VSCode becoming sluggish or unresponsive when Pieces OS is active on Windows. This may be related to resource conflicts or software compatibility issues.
- Review and update the Pieces OS and Desktop App documentation to address common user questions and issues, particularly regarding LTM usage and performance optimization.
- Monitor and address the reported issues with Pieces crashing or freezing on Chrome tabs with large content, as this may indicate memory leaks or resource management problems.
- Investigate the issue with the Sublime Text plugin icon being reported as 'bogus'. This may be a minor issue but affects user experience.
- Consider implementing a more robust system for tracking and managing Discord invite links to prevent expiration and ensure consistent access for users.
- Continue monitoring user feedback and prioritize bug fixes and performance improvements based on frequency and impact on user experience.
- Communicate updates and solutions to users through various channels (e.g., Discord, release notes) to keep them informed and improve transparency.
