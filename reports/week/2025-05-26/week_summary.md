## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop Performance Issues and Freezes
Users report performance issues, including slowdowns and crashes, primarily on macOS, often associated with Long Term Memory (LTM) feature.  Freezes occur after periods of inactivity, especially following chat interactions, on both macOS and Windows.  Users have tried restarting the application and checking for updates, but issues persist. Further investigation into LTM's impact on system resources and potential conflicts with different operating systems is needed.
