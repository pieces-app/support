## Common Issues
### 1. Invalid Discord Invite Links Across Pieces Platforms
Multiple reports indicate invalid Discord invite links on the Pieces website, documentation, and Pieces OS.  The links provided include discord.gg/getpieces, discord.com/invite/getpieces, and discord.gg/ubn8JFAXQ7.  A permanent, non-expiring link should replace these instances across all platforms.

**Related Issues:**
- [#723](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/723): Discord link provided is invalid on the website
- [#724](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/724): Discord link provided is invalid in Pieces OS
- [#718](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/718): Pieces crash when on Chrome tab with a lot of content

### 2. Pieces Desktop Application Bugs Across Platforms
Users reported various issues with the Pieces desktop application, including: on MacOS, the app periodically jumps to the main monitor and steals focus; on Windows, the app crashes when a Chrome tab has extensive content (e.g., large log files); and an incorrect icon is displayed for the Sublime Text plugin in the Connected Applications menu.  Reinstallation may resolve the MacOS focus issue. The Windows crashes may be related to resource constraints. The incorrect icon is a visual bug needing correction.

### 3. Pieces for Windows: Issues with VS Code extension, crashes, and incorrect icons
Users reported issues with the Pieces Windows app, including the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading, application crashes when Chrome tabs have extensive content (e.g., long logs), and incorrect icons displayed for the Sublime Text plugin in the Connected Applications menu.  The crashes seem to occur with large amounts of data being processed. Icon issue is visual only. Further investigation needed for all issues.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Discord invite link issue across all platforms (website, documentation, Pieces OS) by implementing a permanent, non-expiring link.
- Investigate and address the Pieces desktop application crashes on Windows when Chrome tabs contain extensive content, possibly related to resource constraints.
- Fix the MacOS desktop application issue where it periodically jumps to the main monitor and steals focus.
- Correct the visual bug where the Sublime Text plugin displays an incorrect icon in the Connected Applications menu.
- Investigate and resolve the issue with the VS Code extension's copy button endlessly loading on Windows.
- Monitor and triage new incoming tickets to ensure timely resolution and identify emerging trends or recurring issues across different applications and operating systems (Windows, MacOS).
