The Pieces settings window is either empty or displays install/launch buttons that result in connection errors.  VS Code developer tools show errors related to Pieces OS extension and version strings. Pieces OS logs indicate a 404 error for asset identifiers.  Potential solutions include verifying network connectivity, checking Pieces OS version compatibility with WSL, and ensuring correct configuration of the Pieces extension within VS Code.",

Piesces Setting window is empty, but earlier it showed two buttons Launch and Install and when you click on Install, for example, VS Code shows notification that it can't connect to Pieces OS. I tried multiple fixes I found. One is to set Custom URL for Remote environment and I tried with <Windows IP>:1000 and with NGrok forwarding of same url, both without success and I could reach both with curl. There are some errors in VS Code Developer tools related to Pieces OS extension:\n\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: version is longer than 256 characters\nat new it (settingsView.js:1:5120)\nat UH (settingsView.js:1:9927)\nat Object.tU (settingsView.js:1:10530)\nat vN (settingsView.js:19:354749)\n\nat\nhttps://vscode-remote+wsl-002bubuntu.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/home/vladan/.vscode-server/extensions/meshintelligenttechnologiesinc.pieces-vscode-2.0.6/dist/settingsView.js\n\nand Pieces OS log shows error:\n\nGET     [404] /assets/stream/identifiers: port:Instance of 'Future<int>': (2nd server)\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
