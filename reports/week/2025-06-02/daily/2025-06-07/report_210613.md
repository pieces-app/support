| [#731](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/731) | Pieces Copilot doesn't get the LTM info and shows a wrong date | 4.34 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Copilot ignores LTM context, displays wrong date
Copilot struggles to utilize LTM information for generating relevant responses, often resorting to unrelated topics.  Specifying context details like lecture name improves accuracy. Additionally, the displayed context time is inaccurate, showing "Last Thursday" regardless of the actual time.
