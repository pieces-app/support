## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and plugin issues
Users are experiencing issues with Pieces OS and its Chrome plugin. The plugin is not working properly, buttons and features are unusable, and the sidebar cannot connect. The desktop app indicates that the plugin is outdated, even when the latest version is installed. Additionally, the "Clear Long Term Memory Data" function does not fully clear user data, requiring manual deletion of local files.  A more comprehensive clear data feature or separate options to clear specific data types are desired.
