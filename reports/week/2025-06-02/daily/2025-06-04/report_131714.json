However, I noticed that clicking \u201cClear Long Term Memory Data\u201d does not remove Captured Context or Workstream Activity. These still persist after performing the action.\n\n\ud83e\uddea Steps to Reproduce:\nOpen Pieces and go to Settings.\n\nClick on Clear Long Term Memory Data.\n\nObserve that Captured Context and Workstream Activity remain unchanged.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Expected Behavior:\nAll user-related data (including context and activity) should be removed \u2014 or at the very least, there should be options to remove these explicitly.\n\n\ud83d\udee0 Temporary Workaround:\nThanks to support on Discord, I was told the only way to fully delete everything is to manually delete the following directory while Pieces is closed:\n\nmacOS \u2014 ~/Library/com.pieces.os/\n\nWindows \u2014 C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\com.pieces.os\\\n\nLinux \u2014 ~/.local/share/com.pieces.os/\n\nWould be awesome to see this addressed either with:\n\nA more comprehensive \u201cClear All Data\u201d feature, or\n\nSeparate options to clear Captured Context and Workstream Activity\n\nThanks!\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
