However, I noticed that clicking \u201cClear Long Term Memory Data\u201d does not remove Captured Context or Workstream Activity. These still persist after performing the action.\n\n\ud83e\uddea Steps to Reproduce:\nOpen Pieces and go to Settings.\n\nClick on Clear Long Term Memory Data.\n\nObserve that Captured Context and Workstream Activity remain unchanged.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Expected Behavior:\nAll user-related data (including context and activity) should be removed \u2014 or at the very least, there should be options to remove these explicitly.\n\n\ud83d\udee0 Temporary Workaround:\nThanks to support on Discord, I was told the only way to fully delete everything is to manually delete the following directory while Pieces is closed:\n\nmacOS \u2014 ~/Library/com.pieces.os/\n\nWindows \u2014 C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\com.pieces.os\\\n\nLinux \u2014 ~/.local/share/com.pieces.os/\n\nWould be awesome to see this addressed either with:\n\nA more comprehensive \u201cClear All Data\u201d feature, or\n\nSeparate options to clear Captured Context and Workstream Activity\n\nThanks!\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

I asked it to generate some quiz questions based on what I studied, and it started talking about a lot of unrelated topics, even when the context was provided. Though when I started a new chat based on the context again and became more specific with the details such as lecture name and number (that was the one and only thing in the context I started the conversation with), it did it correctly. Also, all this while, the context time showed Last Thursday so I think there is an UI bug too. \n\n**Context Image:**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab732ff6-d195-4e81-a2af-6cee1e1d2032)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it talks about unrelated topics):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6abd44-60a0-4f0c-9f8a-1cf1a887fd2e)\n\n**Chat Image (Where it was fixed):**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d86c81-ba0e-4ec3-8e2f-49a326ac232a)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
