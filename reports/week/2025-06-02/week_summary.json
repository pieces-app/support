I had also noticed this kind of behavior before the updated but put it on the count of my Hardware, Intel i5, 16Gbram Asus Vivobook, but I think I can dismiss this theory.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is that this behavior seems to only happen if I had, prior to returning to Pieces Desktop, interacted with a chat. In cases where I simply had started Desktop, worked on something else and gone back to Desktop, it would keep working properly.\n\nNoteworthy: LTM is enabled by default for all chats.
