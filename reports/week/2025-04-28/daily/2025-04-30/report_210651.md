| [#584](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/584) | Copilot is not giving any feedback | 3.23 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot not generating feedback, stuck loading
Users report Copilot not generating any feedback on macOS Desktop Application (Pieces for Developers 3.3.3).  Copilot continuously loads without producing output.  Error messages indicate a 404 for the Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro`.  This suggests an issue with model access or availability.

## Recommendations
- Investigate the 404 error for the Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` to restore Copilot functionality on macOS.
- Prioritize resolution of issue #584, "Copilot is not giving any feedback," as it blocks Copilot usage on macOS Desktop Application.
- Monitor Copilot stability and performance on macOS after implementing the fix for issue #584.
- Consider adding improved error handling and user messaging within the application for model access issues to provide a better user experience.
- Proactively communicate the resolution of the Copilot issue to affected users once the fix is deployed.
