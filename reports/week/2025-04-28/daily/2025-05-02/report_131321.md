## Common Issues
### 1. Asana Handshake and Copilot Unresponsiveness
Users report Asana integration handshake failures and Copilot unresponsiveness.  Asana issue involves webhook setup and "x-hook-secret" header handling. Copilot problem manifests as infinite loading, despite conversation summaries updating.  Suggested solutions include verifying Asana webhook configuration, checking network connectivity, and examining Pieces logs for errors.

## Recommendations
- Investigate Asana integration handshake failures and Copilot unresponsiveness. Verify Asana webhook configuration and x-hook-secret header handling. Check network connectivity and Pieces logs for errors related to Copilot's infinite loading issue.
- Prioritize resolution of issues related to Asana handshake (ticket #702) and Copilot unresponsiveness (ticket #701) due to their high activity levels and potential impact on users.
- Review and address the repeated Sentry Event Errors appearing in the logs, as they may provide clues to the Copilot unresponsiveness problem.
- Improve documentation or provide clearer instructions on Asana integration setup and troubleshooting steps for Copilot issues to reduce future support tickets on these topics.
- Monitor support tickets for trends related to specific operating systems (e.g., Windows) and applications (e.g., VS Code, Desktop Application, Web Extension) to identify potential platform-specific bugs or compatibility issues.
- Consider implementing automated tests or health checks for the Asana integration and Copilot functionality to catch issues early and prevent user disruption.
- Gather more data on the specific conditions under which Copilot becomes unresponsive, such as network conditions, user actions, or specific conversation types, to aid in debugging and resolution.
- Analyze the 'Publisher Model not found' error message related to the Gemini-Pro model and ensure the project has the necessary access permissions and is using a valid model version.
- For issues related to the Early Access Program, ensure users have the latest version of the software and provide clear communication channels for reporting feedback and issues.
- Track the effectiveness of implemented solutions by monitoring ticket resolution times, recurring issues, and user feedback to continuously improve support operations and product quality.
