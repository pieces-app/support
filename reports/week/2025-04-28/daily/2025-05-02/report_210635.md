## Common Issues
### 1. Asana Handshake and Copilot Unresponsiveness
Users report Asana integration handshake failures and Copilot unresponsiveness.  The Asana issue involves webhook creation and header handling during the handshake process.  Copilot's issue manifests as continuous loading, despite conversation summaries updating.  Suggested solutions include verifying Asana webhook setup, header values, and checking Pieces Copilot logs for errors.

- Prioritize Windows desktop application bug fixes.
- Review and improve documentation/support resources for Asana integration and Copilot usage.
- Monitor and address any recurring Sentry Event Errors related to Copilot.
