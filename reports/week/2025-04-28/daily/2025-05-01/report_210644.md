## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot Unresponsive, Constant Loading
Users across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) report Copilot unresponsiveness.  Copilot continuously loads without generating responses in conversations within the app or extensions. Some conversations may show summaries or name updates, but no chat responses.  Troubleshooting steps like resetting, restarting, reinstalling, and switching between On-Device and Cloud LLMs have been unsuccessful.  Log files contain repeated Sentry Event Errors. Further investigation into these errors is needed.
