Copilot continuously loads without generating responses in conversations within the app or extensions. Some conversations may show summaries or name updates, but no chat responses.  Troubleshooting steps like resetting, restarting, reinstalling, and switching between On-Device and Cloud LLMs have been unsuccessful.  Log files contain repeated Sentry Event Errors. Further investigation into these errors is needed.",

It just keeps loading. I've tried hard-resetting, restarting, reinstalling, On-Device LLMs, and Cloud LLMs. The weird thing is, some of the conversations will have a summary or will update the name of the conversation, but it never responds in the chat. I looked at the logs and saw repeated Sentry Event Errors, but not sure what to do with that.  I attached the log file from the day before yesterday (yesterday's is too large and won't upload). What should I do?\n\nThanks!\n\n[log-04292025.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19997109/log-04292025.txt)\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
