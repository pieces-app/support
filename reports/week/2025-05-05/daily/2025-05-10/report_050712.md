| [#706](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/706) | Pieces for Developers doesn't support .vue files | 8.20 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces for Developers doesn't support .vue files
Users are unable to add Vue Single File Component (.vue) files to Pieces due to file extension restrictions in the file selector.  This prevents using .vue files as context. A potential solution could be adding support for .vue files in the Pieces file selector.
