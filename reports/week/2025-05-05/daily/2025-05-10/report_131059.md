| [#706](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/706) | Pieces for Developers doesn't support .vue files | 8.20 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces for Developers doesn't support .vue files
Users are unable to add Vue Single File Component (.vue) files to Pieces due to file extension restrictions in the file selector.  This prevents using .vue files as context.  A potential solution could be updating the file selector to accept .vue files or providing alternative methods for adding Vue components to Pieces.

## Recommendations
- Investigate why .vue files are not supported and implement support if feasible.
- Update documentation or user interface to reflect .vue file support status.
- Monitor for any emerging trends related to file type support requests from users and prioritize accordingly.
- Consider adding functionality to allow users to manually add files of any type as context if there are valid use cases beyond .vue files.
- Review the 404 error encountered when generating summaries for the 'Pieces for Developers doesn't support .vue files' issue and address the underlying cause related to the Publisher Model access or configuration.
- Proactively communicate with users about the status and planned resolution of the .vue file support issue (e.g., via a public issue tracker or community forum).
