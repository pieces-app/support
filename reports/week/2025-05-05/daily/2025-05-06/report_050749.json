It does not start downloading the model. I have tried downloading all the available models, but it does not move further than initialising. I have seen a similar issue on GitHub for somebody using windows, but for them, it went away after updating to version 8.0.0. of pieces OS. This is their GitHub issue https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/84 I am already on 8.0.1 but on Linux. I am pretty sure my internet is not an issue. The rest of the app functions perfectly. It's just that I cannot download local LLMs. I have also tried to install local LLMs through VS Code, but there instead of getting stuck on initializing it gets stuck on 0% complete.\r\n\r\nI am on Linux\r\npieces OS : 8.0.1\r\npieces for developers : 2.10.0\r\nOS : Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\r\nCPU: Ryzen 5800H\r\nRam: 16gb\r\nGPU: RTX 3050 mobile (4gbvram)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/assets/106009563/a0d2900b-276a-4450-a0f4-100e1f8391d7)\r\n![image](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/assets/106009563/32fc5059-a497-4b5f-9be7-e498cd56329c)\r\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
