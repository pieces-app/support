## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and Desktop App Bugs
Users reported issues with Pieces OS login (HTTP 500 error), Asana handshake failures in the desktop app, and crashes due to native_extensions_plugin.dll.  The login issue appears related to a server-side error.  The Asana issue may involve incorrect webhook setup or header handling.  The crash might be resolved by disabling or updating the problematic plugin. Further investigation is needed for all issues.

**Related Issues:**
- [#702](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/702): I'm unable to do Handshake with asana
- [#691](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/691): OS: login does not work ( /os/sign_in HTTP 500)
- [#693](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/693): Crash due to native_extensions_plugin.dll

### 2. Pieces OS crashes or freezes during login or LLM download
Users experience crashes during login or when downloading LLMs. Login attempts result in HTTP 500 errors, infinite spinners, or authentication error pages. LLM downloads get stuck on initializing. Issues appear across different OS versions (8.0.1, 11.3.3) and platforms (Linux, Windows).  Suggested solutions include checking logs, reinstalling the app, disabling antivirus/firewall, updating graphics drivers, or checking internet connectivity. A related issue on Windows was resolved by updating to 8.0.0.

- [#693](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/693): Crash due to native_extensions_plugin.dll

### 3. Pieces Desktop App and OS Issues
Users are experiencing various issues with the Pieces desktop app and OS, including connection problems ("Invalid Port"), file type restrictions (.vue files not supported), and local LLM download failures.  Troubleshooting steps include checking antivirus software, restarting/reinstalling the app, and verifying internet connectivity.  Further investigation is needed for the LLM download issue on Linux.

**Related Issues:**
- [#672](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/672): Invalid Port (at character 18) http://127.0.0.1:null/connect

### 4. Pieces OS/PFD Issues on Linux
Users on Ubuntu Linux are experiencing various issues with Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers (PFD). These include an upside-down GUI, login failures with HTTP 500 errors, and local LLM downloads getting stuck on initializing.  Troubleshooting steps include reinstalling/updating software, checking logs, and verifying internet connectivity.  Similar issues have been reported on Windows, sometimes resolved by updating to Pieces OS 8.0.0.

**Related Issues:**
- [#705](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/705): Pieces for developers GUI is upside down on Ubuntu 24.04
- [#691](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/691): OS: login does not work ( /os/sign_in HTTP 500)
- [#113](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/113): Download of local LLM's initializes, but never proceeds 

### 5. Pieces OS conflicts with other software and antivirus
Users report conflicts between Pieces OS and other applications like Kaspersky and Visual Studio. Kaspersky flags Pieces OS as a virus, while the Pieces VS extension interferes with diagnostic tools.  Additionally, a "Invalid Port" error suggests Pieces OS might have trouble connecting to local services, potentially due to antivirus software or firewall interference.  Check antivirus settings and ensure Pieces OS is allowed.  Disable extensions or plugins to isolate conflicts.  Verify network connectivity and port availability for Pieces OS.

- [#663](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/663): Kaspersky Internet Security flags Pieces OS as a virus
- [#697](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/697): Visual Studio 2022 extension interfering with Diagnostic tool output
