## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers Issues on Linux
Users reported GUI issues, specifically an upside-down display on Ubuntu 24.04 with Pieces for Developers and issues downloading local LLMs getting stuck on initializing on Ubuntu 22.04.  Reinstallation and updates did not resolve the GUI issue.  The LLM download issue persisted across multiple models and also affected VS Code integration, stalling at 0%.

### 2. Pieces OS crashes and conflicts with other software
Pieces OS users report crashes related to native_extensions_plugin.dll, conflicts with Visual Studio's diagnostic tools, and false positive virus detections by Kaspersky.  Troubleshooting includes reinstalling Pieces OS, disabling antivirus/firewall, updating graphics drivers, and disabling the problematic plugin. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and provide a permanent solution.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Linux GUI issue (upside-down display) and the local LLM download issue, as these affect core functionality and have high activity levels.
- Investigate the native_extensions_plugin.dll crash on Windows and the conflict with Visual Studio's diagnostic tools to identify the root cause and provide a fix.
- Address the false positive virus detection by Kaspersky Internet Security to avoid unnecessary user concern and improve the installation experience.
- Improve documentation and communication around known issues, particularly for Linux users, and provide clear workarounds or temporary solutions.
- Monitor support tickets for emerging trends and prioritize issues based on frequency, activity level, and impact on users.
