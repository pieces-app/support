## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers Issues on Linux
Users reported GUI issues, specifically an upside-down display on Ubuntu 24.04 with Pieces OS 11.3.6 and Pieces for Developers. Another user experienced issues downloading local LLMs on Ubuntu 22.04 with Pieces OS 8.0.1 and Pieces for Developers 2.10.0, where downloads stalled during initialization.  Reinstallation and updates did not resolve the GUI issue. Further investigation is needed for both the display and LLM download problems.

### 2. Pieces OS crashes and conflicts with other software
Pieces OS users report crashes related to native_extensions_plugin.dll, conflicts with Visual Studio's diagnostic tools, and false positive virus detections by Kaspersky.  Troubleshooting includes reinstalling Pieces OS, disabling antivirus/firewall, updating graphics drivers, and disabling the problematic plugin. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and provide a permanent solution.
