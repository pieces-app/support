      "description": "Users are encountering authentication errors when installing Pieces, often through UltraEdit, on Windows VDIs with security software like Cortex XDR.  The error manifests as a redirect to an authentication error URL. This might be due to network restrictions imposed by the security software blocking necessary connections.  Check if your security software is blocking connections to Pieces servers and configure exceptions if needed.",

If so, I probably can't use Pieces at work.  I highly doubt they will open any ports for this.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
