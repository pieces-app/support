## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication Error During Pieces Installation on Windows VDIs
Users are encountering authentication errors when installing Pieces, often through UltraEdit, on Windows Virtual Desktop Infrastructures (VDIs) with security software like Cortex XDR.  The issue may be related to blocked ports by the security software, preventing connection to the authentication site.  This might require adjustments to the VDI's security settings or firewall rules.
