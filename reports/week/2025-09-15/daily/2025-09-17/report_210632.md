## Common Issues
### 1. Authentication Error During Pieces Installation on Windows VDI
Users are encountering authentication errors when installing Pieces, often through UltraEdit, on Windows VDIs with security software like Cortex XDR.  The error manifests as a redirect to an authentication error URL. This might be due to network restrictions imposed by the security software blocking necessary connections.  Check if your security software is blocking connections to Pieces servers and configure exceptions if needed.
