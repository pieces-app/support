## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces fails to start after update on Linux and Windows
Users on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Windows 11 report Pieces failing to start after recent updates. On Linux, the application crashes at startup with XCB errors. On Windows, it hangs at "Ensure Core Dependencies" screen.  Reinstallation doesn't resolve the issue. Logs indicate potential conflicts with GTK+ versions on Linux.
