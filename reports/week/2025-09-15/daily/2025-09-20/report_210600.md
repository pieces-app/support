## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS and Pieces Desktop startup failures across platforms
Users are experiencing startup failures with PiecesOS and Pieces Desktop on Windows and Linux. Symptoms include the "Ensure Core Dependencies" message, application crashes, and the PiecesOS service not running.  Reinstallation has not resolved the issue.  Logs indicate potential conflicts with GTK+ versions on Linux and multiple PiecesOS installations on Windows.  Further investigation into data corruption or conflicting installations is needed.
