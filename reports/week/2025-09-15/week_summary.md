## Common Issues
### 1. Users unable to connect to Authentication site during Pieces install
Users on Windows and MacOS are encountering authentication errors during Pieces installation, potentially due to security software like Cortex XDR blocking connections.  The error manifests as an UnauthenticatedUserException and redirects to an authentication error URL.  Users may need to configure their security software or firewalls to allow Pieces to connect.

## Recommendations

- Address the underlying causes of the "UnauthenticatedUserException" error.
- Improve installation documentation and troubleshooting guides to help users resolve authentication problems independently.
