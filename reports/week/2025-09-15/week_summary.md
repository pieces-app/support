- Improve communication around cloud connectivity problems, focusing on authentication errors and potential conflicts with security software or browser extensions.
- Develop more robust troubleshooting steps for startup issues, including clear instructions for checking logs, verifying authentication, and managing multiple installations.
- Consider adding in-app diagnostics or self-help resources to guide users through common troubleshooting steps for startup and connectivity issues.
