## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and Desktop App Fail to Start After Update
Users are unable to launch Pieces Desktop after updating Pieces OS. The app gets stuck on "Ensure Core Dependencies" screen.  Reinstalling doesn't resolve the issue.  Problem may stem from Pieces OS service failing to start, potentially due to update conflicts or data corruption.  Logs indicate authentication issues.  Workarounds include checking firewall/antivirus settings and potentially wiping all local Pieces data (though this leads to data loss).
