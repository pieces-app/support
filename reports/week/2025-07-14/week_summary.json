No new workstream summaries have been generated since mid\u2011July 2025. Manual roll\u2011up always fails with \u201cunable to find any workstream events.\u201d  \n2. Pieces Desktop reports \u201cOllama needs to be installed\u201d even though `ollama` is in `$PATH` and the service is running on `127.0.0.1:11434`.\n\n---\n\n**To Reproduce**  \n1. **Environment**  \n   - OS: Linux Mint 22.1 \u201cCinnamon\u201d (X11) (64\u2011bit)  \n   - Kernel: 6.8.0\u201162\u2011generic\n   - PiecesOS v12.1.0 (snap)\n   - Pieces Desktop: v4.3.1\n   - Ollama CLI: `/usr/local/bin/ollama` (installed via official script)  \n   - Ollama service: running (`ollama serve` \u2192 `Error: bind: address already in use`; confirmed via browser at http://127.0.0.1:11434)\n\n2. **Workstream summary failure**  \n   - Open Pieces Desktop \u2192 Workstream Activity  \n   - Observe events up through July\u202f9, 2025, but no events or summaries for July\u202f10\u201313.  \n   - Click \u201cGenerate manual Workstream Rollup\u201d for any time window \u2192 error:  \n     ```\n     unable to find any workstream events\n     ```\n\n3. **Ollama detection failure**  \n   - Verify in terminal:  \n     ```bash\n     which ollama\n     \u2192 /usr/local/bin/ollama\n\n     ollama list\n     \u2192 (lists available models)\n\n     curl http://127.0.0.1:11434\n     \u2192 \u201cOllama is running\u201d\n     ```  \n   - In Pieces Desktop, attempt to enable \u201cLocal Models\u201d \u2192 receives error \u201cOllama needs to be installed.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Expected behavior**  \n- Workstream summaries continue to be generated daily (or allow manual roll\u2011ups to succeed).  \n- Pieces Desktop auto\u2011detects my installed Ollama CLI + service and lists local models.\n\n---\n\n**Screenshots & Logs**  \n- **Pieces log directory**: `~/.local/share/com.pieces.os.dependency_management/` shows logs only up to July\u202f9.\n- **No error messages** appear in those dependency logs.  \n\n---\n\n**Additional context**  \n- I\u2019ve already:  \n  - Verified `snap refresh` and `apt update && apt upgrade` to ensure latest PiecesOS and Desktop.  \n  - Stopped/restarted any existing Ollama service (killed port 11434, rebooted, then `ollama serve`).  \n  - Manually pointed Pieces Desktop at `/usr/local/bin/ollama` and `http://127.0.0.1:11434` in settings, then fully quit & relaunched the app.  \n- Issue has persisted for >1\u202fweek.\n\nPlease let me know what additional details I can provide to help debug.

After installing, creating an account, etc. I started UltraEdit and was looking forward to the integration. What I was met with was a window that said that Pieces isn't running with an error unable to determine Pieces connection port. After some discussion, UltraEdit team said that I was likely missing the file %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\com.pieces.os\\production\\Config\\.port.txt\nTurns out I'm missing the directory com.pieces.os. I has not been created. I uninstalled all the Pieces apps and reinstalled from the website, hoping that this directory would be created. Now UltraEdit says Pieces for Developers is not installed and prompts me to Download Pieces. Clicking that link takes me directly to the page I just downloaded from.\nI suggested to UltraEdit support that I could recreate the directory structure and add .port.txt, but they said instead that I should contact you. While you are looking at this, I am going to do a complete uninstall of UltraEdit and Pieces components, deleting any registry keys I can find (as uninstall doesn't remove any), and remove the .pieces_identites folder from Documents, then do a complete reinstall.\nLooking forward to a solution to this.\nRegards,\nIan Hannah\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
