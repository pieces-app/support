## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces user settings not saving across sessions
Users report that settings in both the VS Code extension and desktop app are not persisting.  The VS Code extension repeatedly prompts for login despite Pieces OS running.  The desktop app's Auto-Generated Context setting reverts to "Medium" after being changed. This occurs across Windows and macOS platforms and persists across app and OS updates.  Troubleshooting steps should include verifying login status, checking for conflicts with other extensions or software, and ensuring settings files are properly saved and loaded.

- Address the Auto-Generated Context setting reverting to "Medium" in the desktop app, ensuring settings are saved and loaded correctly.
- Improve communication with users regarding known issues and their resolution progress.
