The desktop app's Auto-Generated Context setting reverts to \"Medium\" after being changed. This occurs across Windows and macOS platforms and persists across app and OS updates.  Troubleshooting steps should include verifying login status, checking for conflicts with other extensions or software, and ensuring settings files are properly saved and loaded.",

When changing the Auto-Generated Context (Saved Material Enrichment) option in Machine Learning from the menu, in my case I want it to be \"High\", but every time I change it, when I check the next day or any time later, or every time the app or os updates, the option selected goes back to \"Medium\". So I don't actually even know if it ever used \"High\", because it always returns the option to \"Medium\".\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
