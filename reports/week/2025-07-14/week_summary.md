## Common Issues
### 1. Workstream/LTM Activity not updating/Ollama not detected
Users are experiencing issues with Workstream/LTM not recording new activities or updating. This affects macOS and Linux users and might be related to Pieces OS or Desktop application. Some users also report Ollama not being detected despite being installed and running.  Suggested solutions include restarting Pieces, checking Ollama installation/path, and verifying Pieces OS version compatibility.
