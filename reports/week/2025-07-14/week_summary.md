## Common Issues
### 1. Workstream/LTM Activity Recording and Ollama Detection Failures
Multiple users report Workstream Activity and LTM failing to record new activity on macOS and Linux.  One user experienced complete stoppage after 20 minutes. Another user reports missing summaries since mid-July with manual rollup failures.  Ollama detection is also failing on Linux Mint despite the service running.  Suggested troubleshooting includes verifying Pieces OS and Desktop versions, restarting Ollama, and checking logs.

### 2. Pieces OS integration failures across multiple platforms
Users on Linux, Windows, and within VS Code report Pieces OS integration issues. Problems include broken workstream summaries, failure to detect Ollama on Linux, missing configuration files on Windows preventing UltraEdit integration, and VS Code extension sign-in errors.  Reinstallation and manual configuration attempts have been unsuccessful.  The common thread is Pieces OS failing to communicate or be detected by other applications.
