## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS/Desktop Startup Failure After Update
Users report Pieces OS and Desktop failing to start after an update, stuck at "Ensure Core Dependencies" screen.  Logs indicate multiple Pieces OS installations. Uninstalling all but one installation through "Add or Remove Programs" is recommended.  Reinstalling from scratch does not resolve the issue. Further investigation into conflicting installations or data corruption may be needed if the issue persists after uninstalling duplicate installations.

- Investigate the "Pieces OS/Desktop Startup Failure After Update" issue. Root cause appears to be multiple Pieces OS installations.  A solution involving uninstalling duplicates is available, but a more robust fix is needed to prevent this.
- Improve the update process to prevent multiple Pieces OS installations or provide an automated cleanup mechanism.
- Consider adding a check for multiple installations during startup and prompting the user with clear instructions on how to resolve the conflict.
