## Common Issues
### 1. Multiple PiecesOS Installations Detected
Users are encountering an error during installation due to multiple PiecesOS instances present on their systems. The error message advises users to uninstall all but one installation via 'Add or Remove Programs' to resolve the issue. This suggests potential conflicts or data corruption risks when running concurrent installations.
