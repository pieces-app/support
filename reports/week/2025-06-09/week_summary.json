Verify MCP Server is Running\n```bash\nlsof -i :39300\n# Shows Pieces OS listening on port 39300 with multiple established connections\n```\n\n### 2. Confirm Tools are Available\n```bash\ncurl -N http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse \\\n  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' &\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tools/list\"}'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 Successfully returns tools list with `ask_pieces_ltm` tool schema\n\n### 3. Test create_pieces_memory (Working)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"create_pieces_memory\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"summary\":\"Test memory\",\n        \"summary_description\":\"Testing connection\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 `\"Long term memory successfully created\"`\n\n### 4.

The `ask_pieces_ltm` tool is properly registered and callable\n2. The MCP communication protocol works correctly\n3. The underlying LTM system has data and functions properly\n4. There's a disconnect between the MCP tool implementation and the LTM data access layer\n\n## Potential Root Causes\n\n1. **Authentication/Session Issue**: MCP server process may lack proper authentication to access LTM data\n2. **Data Access Layer Bug**: `ask_pieces_ltm` implementation may be using incorrect API calls to access LTM\n3. **Permissions Issue**: MCP server may not have the same data access permissions as the main Pieces application\n4. **Initialization Problem**: LTM access for MCP tools may require additional setup or initialization\n\n## Request\n\nPlease investigate the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation in the Pieces MCP server to identify why it cannot access the same LTM data that is clearly available to the main Pieces application.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Issue occurs consistently across different MCP clients (Warp, Claude)\n- `create_pieces_memory` works perfectly, confirming MCP communication\n- LTM is actively collecting and displaying data in the main Pieces app\n- No relevant error logs found in system logs or Pieces application logs\n- Multiple parameter variations attempted with identical results\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
