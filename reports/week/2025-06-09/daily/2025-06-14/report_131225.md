| [#750](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/750) | Delete chat bubbles breaks the onhover chat menu's appearance | 4.42 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Deleting chat bubbles breaks hover menu on grouped bubbles
Deleting a chat bubble (not the latest) causes remaining bubbles to group, and the hover menu only appears on the latest bubble in the group. This occurs on macOS desktop application version 11.4.4.  This appears to be a UI regression.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the issue: "Deleting chat bubbles breaks hover menu on grouped bubbles" as it affects macOS desktop application users. Investigate the related issue (ID 750) and its reproduction steps to understand the root cause and develop a fix.
- Given the UI regression, allocate resources to test the chat bubble deletion functionality across different operating systems and application versions to ensure the issue is isolated to macOS and version 11.4.4.
- Improve the support documentation or FAQs with instructions on how to manage chat bubbles and address potential issues related to deleting them. This can help reduce future support tickets on the same topic.
- Monitor incoming support tickets for similar UI regressions or issues related to chat bubbles to identify any recurring problems or trends. This will help proactively address potential issues and improve the user experience.
- Consider implementing automated UI testing to catch regressions like this earlier in the development process. This can help prevent issues from reaching production and impacting users.
