| [#750](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/750) | Delete chat bubbles breaks the onhover chat menu's appearance | 7.89 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Deleting chat bubbles breaks hover menu on grouped bubbles
Deleting a chat bubble (not the latest) causes remaining bubbles to group, and the hover menu only appears on the latest bubble in the group. This occurs on macOS desktop app version 11.4.4.  It appears to be a UI regression.
