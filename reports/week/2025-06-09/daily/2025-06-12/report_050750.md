| [#747](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/747) | MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" despite functional LTM | 4.42 |

## Common Issues
### 1. ask_pieces_ltm tool consistently fails with "Failed to extract context"
Users report the MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" error, despite a functional LTM and successful communication with the MCP server via other tools like `create_pieces_memory`.  The issue persists across different clients and parameter variations.  Potential root causes include authentication/session issues, data access layer bugs, permissions problems, or initialization errors within the MCP server's interaction with the LTM data.

## Recommendations
- Investigate the root cause of the "Failed to extract context" error in the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool. This appears to be the most frequent issue and is blocking users from accessing LTM data via the MCP.
- Check MCP server logs for errors related to LTM access or authentication.  If no errors are present, add more detailed logging to the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation to pinpoint the failure point.
- Verify the MCP server's authentication and permissions to access LTM data. Ensure it has the same level of access as the main Pieces application.
- Test the LTM data access layer directly (bypassing the MCP) to confirm data integrity and accessibility. This will help isolate whether the issue is within the LTM system or the MCP integration.
- Consider adding health checks or monitoring for the MCP server and its connection to the LTM system to proactively detect and address future issues.
- Update the documentation or provide more helpful error messages to users experiencing the "Failed to extract context" error.  This can include troubleshooting steps or workarounds while the issue is being investigated.
- Prioritize resolution of issue #747 as it represents the most active and impactful problem for users currently experiencing issues with the MCP and LTM integration.
- Once the issue is resolved, add automated tests to cover the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool and its interaction with the LTM system to prevent regressions in the future.
- Communicate the resolution of the issue to affected users and update any relevant support documentation or FAQs.
- Monitor support tickets for any recurring patterns or new issues related to the MCP and LTM integration to identify potential areas for improvement or further investigation.
