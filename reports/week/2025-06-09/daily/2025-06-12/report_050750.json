The issue persists across different clients and parameter variations.  Potential root causes include authentication/session issues, data access layer bugs, permissions problems, or initialization errors within the MCP server's interaction with the LTM data.",

          "text": "MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns \"Failed to extract context\" despite functional LTM\n### Checked for Existing Issues?\n\n- [x] Yes, I have checked existing issues and cannot find one related to this.\n\n### Software\n\nDesktop Application\n\n### Operating System / Platform\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.5\n\n### Your Pieces OS Version\n\n11.4.4\n\n### Early Access Program\n\n- [ ] Yes, this is related to an Early Access Program feature.\n\n### Kindly describe the bug and include as much detail as possible on what you were doing so we can reproduce the bug.\n\n## Bug Report\n\n**Environment:**\n- OS: macOS Sequoia 15.5\n- Pieces OS: 11.4.4 - Running (PID 699, actively collecting data)\n- Pieces App: 4.1.4 - Active with functional LTM workstream\n- MCP Server: Pieces MCP server on localhost:39300\n- Test Client: Warp Terminal Agent Mode, Claude, direct curl testing\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe `ask_pieces_ltm` MCP tool consistently returns `\"Failed to extract context\"` with `\"isError\": true`, despite:\n\n1. \u2705 **LTM is working correctly** - User confirmed LTM is collecting data and showing results/summaries in the Pieces workstream\n2. \u2705 **MCP server communication works** - Can successfully call `create_pieces_memory` and list tools\n3. \u2705 **Pieces OS is running and active** - Process running with multiple active connections\n4. \u274c **Only `ask_pieces_ltm` fails** - Every call to this specific tool fails\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n### 1. Verify MCP Server is Running\n```bash\nlsof -i :39300\n# Shows Pieces OS listening on port 39300 with multiple established connections\n```\n\n### 2. Confirm Tools are Available\n```bash\ncurl -N http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse \\\n  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' &\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tools/list\"}'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 Successfully returns tools list with `ask_pieces_ltm` tool schema\n\n### 3. Test create_pieces_memory (Working)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"create_pieces_memory\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"summary\":\"Test memory\",\n        \"summary_description\":\"Testing connection\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 `\"Long term memory successfully created\"`\n\n### 4. Test ask_pieces_ltm (Failing)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":3,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"ask_pieces_ltm\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"question\":\"What did I work on today?\",\n        \"chat_llm\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u274c `{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Failed to extract context\"}],\"isError\":true}`\n\n## Attempted Variations (All Failed)\n\n### Minimal Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"hello\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n}\n```\n\n### With Application Sources\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What terminal commands have I run recently?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\"],\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\"\n}\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What did I work on today?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\", \"Google Chrome\"],\n  \"topics\": [\"terminal\", \"commands\", \"recent\"],\n  \"related_questions\": [\"What was I working on?\", \"What debugging was I doing?\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Different Application Sources Tested\n- `[\"Warp\"]`\n- `[\"Google Chrome\", \"Safari\", \"Obsidian\"]`\n- `[\"Claude\"]`\n- Multiple combinations from the schema list\n\n**All variations return the same error.**\n\n## Troubleshooting Attempted\n\n1. \u2705 **Restarted Pieces MCP server** - Issue persists\n2. \u2705 **Verified Pieces OS permissions** - Has necessary macOS permissions\n3. \u2705 **Confirmed LTM data collection** - User sees active workstream data\n4. \u2705 **Tested different MCP clients** - Same error in Warp Agent Mode, Claude, and direct curl\n5. \u2705 **Used proper SSE endpoint** - `/sse` for responses, `/messages` for requests\n6. \u2705 **Verified JSON-RPC format** - Matches working `create_pieces_memory` calls\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `ask_pieces_ltm` tool should return contextual information from the user's LTM data, similar to how the main Pieces application shows workstream summaries and context.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nEvery call to `ask_pieces_ltm` returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Failed to extract context\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis appears to be an **MCP server implementation issue** where:\n\n1. The `ask_pieces_ltm` tool is properly registered and callable\n2. The MCP communication protocol works correctly\n3. The underlying LTM system has data and functions properly\n4. There's a disconnect between the MCP tool implementation and the LTM data access layer\n\n## Potential Root Causes\n\n1. **Authentication/Session Issue**: MCP server process may lack proper authentication to access LTM data\n2. **Data Access Layer Bug**: `ask_pieces_ltm` implementation may be using incorrect API calls to access LTM\n3. **Permissions Issue**: MCP server may not have the same data access permissions as the main Pieces application\n4. **Initialization Problem**: LTM access for MCP tools may require additional setup or initialization\n\n## Request\n\nPlease investigate the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation in the Pieces MCP server to identify why it cannot access the same LTM data that is clearly available to the main Pieces application.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Issue occurs consistently across different MCP clients (Warp, Claude)\n- `create_pieces_memory` works perfectly, confirming MCP communication\n- LTM is actively collecting and displaying data in the main Pieces app\n- No relevant error logs found in system logs or Pieces application logs\n- Multiple parameter variations attempted with identical results\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate the root cause of the \"Failed to extract context\" error in the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool. This appears to be the most frequent issue and is blocking users from accessing LTM data via the MCP.",
    "Check MCP server logs for errors related to LTM access or authentication.  If no errors are present, add more detailed logging to the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation to pinpoint the failure point.",
    "Verify the MCP server's authentication and permissions to access LTM data. Ensure it has the same level of access as the main Pieces application.",
    "Test the LTM data access layer directly (bypassing the MCP) to confirm data integrity and accessibility. This will help isolate whether the issue is within the LTM system or the MCP integration.",
    "Consider adding health checks or monitoring for the MCP server and its connection to the LTM system to proactively detect and address future issues.",
    "Update the documentation or provide more helpful error messages to users experiencing the \"Failed to extract context\" error.  This can include troubleshooting steps or workarounds while the issue is being investigated.",
    "Prioritize resolution of issue #747 as it represents the most active and impactful problem for users currently experiencing issues with the MCP and LTM integration.",
    "Once the issue is resolved, add automated tests to cover the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool and its interaction with the LTM system to prevent regressions in the future.",
    "Communicate the resolution of the issue to affected users and update any relevant support documentation or FAQs.",
    "Monitor support tickets for any recurring patterns or new issues related to the MCP and LTM integration to identify potential areas for improvement or further investigation. "
