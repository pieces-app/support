## Common Issues
### 1. ask_pieces_ltm MCP tool fails to extract context
Users report the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returning "Failed to extract context" error via MCP, despite functional LTM within the Pieces desktop app.  Issue observed across macOS and Windows, different Pieces OS versions (11.3.6, 11.4.4), and various MCP clients.  Other MCP tools like `create_pieces_memory` function correctly.  Problem likely resides in MCP server's interaction with LTM data access layer.
