## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS startup error on Linux due to RGBA pixel format
Users on Linux (Debian, potentially others) encounter "No available configurations for the given RGBA pixel format" error when starting Pieces OS (v11.0.3, 4.1.4) via terminal, VS Code, or desktop app.  Issue affects NVIDIA GPUs (GTX 1050 Ti reported) with specific drivers (e.g., nvidia v: 535.183.01).  Chromebook users experience similar startup issues with unresponsive buttons and fullscreen problems. Further investigation into graphics driver compatibility and Pieces OS dependencies is needed.
