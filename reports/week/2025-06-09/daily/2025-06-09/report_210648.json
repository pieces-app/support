    "Investigate the Chromebook installation process, particularly the reported screen flickering, slow buffering, and unresponsive buttons, to ensure a smooth user experience.",
    "Gather more data on the frequency and specific circumstances under which LTM turns off on macOS to pinpoint the root cause and implement a permanent fix.",
    "Proactively communicate known issues and workarounds to users through release notes, blog posts, or in-app notifications to manage expectations and reduce support ticket volume.",
    "Analyze user feedback and support tickets to identify any other recurring issues or trends that may require attention and prioritization in future development cycles.",
    "Implement better error handling and logging within the Pieces CLI and Desktop app to capture more detailed information about LTM connection failures, facilitating faster debugging and resolution.",
    "Explore potential improvements to the LTM onboarding process to ensure users understand how to properly configure and utilize the feature, minimizing user errors and support requests.",
    "Consider implementing automated tests to cover installation and startup scenarios across different operating systems to catch compatibility issues early in the development process.",
    "Investigate the possibility of providing alternative installation methods for Chromebook users if the current method continues to present challenges.",
    "Evaluate the feasibility of offering a diagnostics tool within the Pieces app to help users identify and troubleshoot common issues, reducing the need for direct support interaction.",
    "Enhance communication between the development team and support staff to ensure timely updates and information sharing regarding known issues, bug fixes, and planned improvements.",
    "Track the resolution rate and time-to-resolution for LTM-related issues to measure the effectiveness of implemented solutions and identify areas for further optimization.",
    "Analyze user activity data to understand how users are interacting with LTM and identify any usage patterns that may contribute to connection issues or instability.",
    "Consider implementing a user feedback mechanism within the Pieces app to allow users to easily report bugs, suggest improvements, and provide valuable insights for future development.",
    "Regularly review and update the knowledge base and FAQ section with solutions to common issues and troubleshooting steps to empower users to self-serve and reduce support ticket volume."
