### 2. PiecesOS and plugin connection and functionality issues
Users are experiencing problems with PiecesOS and its Chrome plugin. Issues include installation problems on Chromebooks with unresponsive buttons, general connection failures, and outdated plugin messages on Windows despite having the latest version.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and provide solutions across different operating systems and plugin versions.

### 3. Pieces OS and plugin connection issues across platforms

Some report outdated plugin versions despite having the latest from the store.  Logs and screenshots are provided. Further investigation into platform compatibility and plugin updates is needed.

### 4. Chat bubble deletion breaks hover menu UI
Deleting chat bubbles other than the latest one in a group causes the hover menu to only appear on the last bubble. This occurs on macOS and Windows desktop applications, across various Pieces OS versions (10.1.13, 11.4.2, 11.4.4). The issue may be related to how chat bubbles are grouped after deletion.  Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and implement a fix.

- [#734](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/734): bug: LTM continues to turn off, requiring me to turn LTM back on periodically

### 5. LTM Access Failure via MCP despite Functional LTM
Users report the MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" error, even though LTM is functioning correctly within the Pieces application.  The issue persists across different clients and MCP calls. Potential root causes include authentication issues, data access layer bugs within the MCP server, or LTM initialization problems specific to MCP integration.
