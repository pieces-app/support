## Common Issues
### 1. PiecesOS and related components connection issues
Users are experiencing difficulties connecting to PiecesOS from various components, including the Chrome plugin and CLI. Issues include plugin functionality errors, outdated plugin versions, and CLI's failure to retrieve context from LTM.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and provide solutions.  Check for compatibility issues between PiecesOS, plugins, and CLI versions. Ensure PiecesOS and related services are running correctly. Reinstalling components or clearing cache might resolve some issues.

### 2. Chat bubble deletion breaks hover menu

Potential causes include authentication issues, data access layer bugs, or LTM initialization problems within the MCP server implementation.
