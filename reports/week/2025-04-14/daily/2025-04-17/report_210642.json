Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Issue Summary\n\n**Problem:**\n\n- User (johnkennyuk) has two Pieces accounts linked to different emails (one for Github, one for Google). \n- The account linking flow is not working, preventing him from merging the accounts and using his personal domain with the Google account.\n\n**Solutions Discussed:**\n\n- **Manually merging accounts:** Pieces support offered to manually merge the accounts via screen sharing and account linking.\n- **Resetting Github account:** The user's Github account was reset multiple times to ensure clean linking.\n- **Fixing capitalization issue:** A minor inconsistency in capitalization between the user's email addresses was identified as a potential problem.\n- **Disabling email privacy setting in Github:** The user was advised to temporarily disable the email privacy setting in Github for easier linking.\n- **Waiting for the new auth service:** Due to persistent issues, the user decided to wait for the rollout of the new account linking system in March.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n- The new authentication system is now live, and the user has successfully linked their accounts in the correct order using the new app.\n- The issue is considered resolved.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The user's personal domain is now connected to the Google account as requested.\n- The new auth system is expected to resolve similar issues in the future.",

  "recommendations": [
    "**Prioritize account linking issues:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around account linking problems in the Pieces Desktop app. Focus on resolving the underlying causes of these issues to reduce ticket volume.",
    "**Investigate HTTP 500 errors during login:**  A user on Linux reported HTTP 500 errors when attempting to log in. This requires immediate attention to ensure a smooth login experience for all users.",
    "**Improve account linking documentation and user guidance:** Given the persistent issues with account linking, review and enhance the documentation and in-app guidance for this process. Provide clearer instructions and troubleshooting steps.",
    "**Monitor the new authentication system:** While a user reported successful account linking after the new system's implementation, continue monitoring its performance and address any emerging issues promptly.",
    "**Gather more detailed information on Linux issues:** The report of login failures on Linux lacks specifics. Implement better logging or request detailed system information from affected users to facilitate debugging and resolution.",
    "**Consider a dedicated support channel for Pieces OS:**  As Pieces OS is a separate product, evaluate the need for a dedicated support channel or tagging system to handle OS-specific issues more efficiently.",
    "**Proactively communicate known issues and resolutions:**  Maintain a public-facing knowledge base or status page to inform users about known issues, workarounds, and planned resolutions. This can reduce support inquiries and manage user expectations."
