## Recommendations
- **Prioritize account linking issues:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around account linking problems in the Pieces Desktop app. Focus on resolving the underlying causes of these issues to reduce ticket volume.
- **Investigate HTTP 500 errors during login:**  A user on Linux reported HTTP 500 errors when attempting to log in. This requires immediate attention to ensure a smooth login experience for all users.
- **Improve account linking documentation and user guidance:** Given the persistent issues with account linking, review and enhance the documentation and in-app guidance for this process. Provide clearer instructions and troubleshooting steps.
- **Monitor the new authentication system:** While a user reported successful account linking after the new system's implementation, continue monitoring its performance and address any emerging issues promptly.
- **Gather more detailed information on Linux issues:** The report of login failures on Linux lacks specifics. Implement better logging or request detailed system information from affected users to facilitate debugging and resolution.
- **Consider a dedicated support channel for Pieces OS:**  As Pieces OS is a separate product, evaluate the need for a dedicated support channel or tagging system to handle OS-specific issues more efficiently.
- **Proactively communicate known issues and resolutions:**  Maintain a public-facing knowledge base or status page to inform users about known issues, workarounds, and planned resolutions. This can reduce support inquiries and manage user expectations.
