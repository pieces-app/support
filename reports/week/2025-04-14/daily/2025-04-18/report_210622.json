Initialization problems often occur on Windows due to insufficient permissions during installation. Account linking issues involve difficulties linking multiple accounts, primarily Google and GitHub. Solutions include running the installer with admin rights, using WinGet for installation, and awaiting a new authentication service from Pieces.",

Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation: Account Linking Issues with JohnKennyUK\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* JohnKennyUK reported an issue with account linking between his Github and Google accounts.\n* The current account linking system is not working as intended and the Pieces team is actively working on a replacement.\n* Mark, a Pieces support staff member, offered to help JohnKennyUK manually connect his accounts.\n* JohnKennyUK's accounts were temporarily connected, but a capitalization issue prevented a permanent fix.\n* The Pieces team is switching to a new authentication service with better account linking capabilities.\n* JohnKennyUK successfully linked his accounts using the new Auth app, but then accidentally linked them in the wrong order.\n* JohnKennyUK is waiting for a reset to re-link his accounts correctly.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The existing account linking system was not straightforward and caused issues for users.\n* A capitalization issue in email addresses prevented seamless account linking.\n* An accidental wrong-order linking with the new Auth app requires a reset.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark offered to manually merge JohnKennyUK's accounts.\n* JohnKennyUK is waiting for the new authentication service with improved linking capabilities.\n* Mark offered to help JohnKennyUK re-link his accounts after a reset.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* JohnKennyUK's accounts are currently linked but in the wrong order.\n* He is waiting for a reset to re-link his accounts correctly.\n* The new authentication service is under development and is expected to be released by mid-March.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The capitalization issue is a known issue with the existing auth service and will be resolved with the new service.\n* JohnKennyUK is one of the first users to try the new Auth app and his feedback will be valuable for the Pieces team.\n\n**Overall, the Pieces team is committed to resolving account linking issues and improving the user experience.**",
