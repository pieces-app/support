## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Desktop App Initialization and Account Linking Issues
Users report issues with Pieces Desktop app initialization and account linking. Initialization problems often occur on Windows due to insufficient permissions during installation. Account linking issues involve difficulties linking multiple accounts, primarily Google and GitHub. Solutions include running the installer with admin rights, using WinGet for installation, and awaiting a new authentication service from Pieces.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize resolution of account linking issues:** The most frequent and active support tickets revolve around account linking problems in the Pieces Desktop app, particularly on Windows. Focus on resolving the root causes of these issues to reduce ticket volume.
- **Improve installation instructions for Windows:** Guide users to install the Pieces Desktop app using WinGet in an elevated PowerShell session to avoid permission errors during installation.
- **Investigate and address the "Invalid Port" error:**  Despite a workaround, the root cause of the "Invalid Port" error on Windows remains unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine if it's related to antivirus software or other factors.
- **Improve error messaging for OS login issues:** The HTTP 500 error for OS login on Linux doesn't provide users with actionable information. Improve error messages to help users troubleshoot or provide more context to the support team.
- **Consider a dedicated troubleshooting guide for account linking:** Given the persistence of account linking issues, create a comprehensive guide that addresses common problems, solutions, and workarounds.
