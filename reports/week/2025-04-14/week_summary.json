Despite following the documentation and contacting support multiple times, over several years, the issue persists?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLog in to the Pieces Desktop app using my Google account.\nGo to Settings > Account & Cloud Integrations.\nClick on the GitHub integration and authenticate via GitHub.\nAfter authentication, I am redirected back to the app, and only the GitHub account is linked.\nAttempt to add the Google account again, authenticate, and return to the app.\nOnly the Google account is now linked, and the GitHub account is unlinked.\nExpected Behavior: Both Google and GitHub accounts should be linked simultaneously.\n\nActual Behavior: Only one account (either Google or GitHub) is linked at a time. The other account gets unlinked when attempting to add both.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI have been using the same email address for both Google and GitHub accounts since day one.\nI have contacted support in the past, and they have reset data on their end, but the issue persists.\nDisabling the GitHub email privacy option did not resolve the issue.\nEnvironment:\n\nAdditional Context: I would prefer to resolve this issue over GitHub or Discord rather than booking a call, as past contact attempts via calls have not resolved the issue.  Also its not a critical requirement for me to use the app but it would be nice to one day be able to actually use this very old feature.\n## Summary of GitHub Issue Conversation\n\n**Key Points Raised:**\n\n* John encountered issues with account linking, specifically the inability to link his personal domain to his GitHub account.\n* This was due to a known bug in the old authentication service and possibly a case sensitivity issue with email addresses.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n* The current account linking process is not functioning properly.\n* The old authentication service is causing problems.\n* There might be a case sensitivity issue with email addresses.\n\n**Solutions Proposed/Implemented:**\n\n* Mark, a support member, offered to manually merge accounts and guide John through the process.\n* A temporary fix was attempted by resetting John's GitHub account.\n* A new authentication service is being developed and is expected to be ready in March.\n* Mark offered to re-engage with John once the new system is available.\n\n**Current Status/Outcome:**\n\n* John successfully linked his accounts using the new authentication app but in the wrong order.\n* He needs his accounts reset so he can re-link them correctly.\n* Mark offered to schedule a time to resolve the issue.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The case sensitivity issue with email addresses needs further investigation.\n* The new authentication service is expected to resolve account linking problems.\n\n**Overall, the issue has not been fully resolved, but a solution is on the horizon with the new authentication service. In the meantime, Mark is available to help John manually.**",

Users are able to link their Google accounts and successfully login.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n* Users experiencing further issues are advised to check their local support logs and contact Pieces support.",
