While the Discord team has confirmed that this feature should be available on Linux, the Pieces OS interface explicitly shows that the feature is not available for Linux systems.\n\n### Current Behavior\n- Pieces OS shows a message indicating Long-Term Memory is not available for Linux\n- Long-Term Memory functionality does not work on the Linux platform\n- Other operating systems appear to have this feature working correctly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- Long-Term Memory feature should be available and functional on Linux, as confirmed by the Discord team\n\n### Evidence\n- [Discord communication confirming feature availability](https://discord.com/channels/1098986658851999776/1320479548797882430/1320643614443048971)\n\n- ![Screenshot showing Pieces OS message about feature unavailability on Linux](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6cb2d0-ef52-4194-bd57-c8a84be2d0db)\n\n\n\n### Questions\n1. When can Linux users expect this feature to be fully available?\n2. Is there a planned timeline for Linux support?\n3. Are there any workarounds available in the meantime?\n\n### System Information\n- Operating System: Linux [Zorin OS 17.2 based on Linux 6.8.0-50-generic~22.04.1-Ubuntu]\n- Pieces OS Version: [PiecesOS 11.0.3]\n- Desktop App: [Pieces for Developers 3.3.2]\n\n### Additional Notes\nThis feature is currently working on other operating systems, and Linux users would greatly benefit from having access to this functionality.\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
