| [#315](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/315) | Pieces desktop application is very slow/laggy, not generating any response in copilot chat. | 6.39 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces desktop app slow/laggy, unresponsive Copilot chat
Users report slow performance and unresponsiveness in the Pieces desktop app, especially Copilot chat, after the latest update on Windows.  A hard reset does not resolve the issue. An error message indicates a 404 for the Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro`. This suggests a problem with the model access or version.
