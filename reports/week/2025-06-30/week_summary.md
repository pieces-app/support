## Common Issues
### 1. Ollama installation failure and application slowness
Users reported issues with Ollama failing to install on Linux (v11) with an immediate error dialog.  Separately, slow performance and unresponsiveness were observed on Windows (v10) after a recent update, even after a hard reset. Both issues hinder core functionality.

- Investigate and address the performance issues reported on Windows (Issue #315) affecting core application responsiveness.
- Proactively monitor and address known issues to prevent recurrence and improve user experience.
- Consider expanding support resources or documentation to address common issues and reduce ticket volume.
