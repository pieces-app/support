## Common Issues
### 1. Ollama installation failure and application slowness
Users reported issues with Ollama failing to install on Linux (v11) with an immediate error dialog.  Separate reports on Windows (v10) indicated application slowness and unresponsiveness in the Copilot chat feature, especially after the latest update.  A hard reset did not resolve the slowness issue. Further investigation is needed for both the installation failure and performance degradation.
