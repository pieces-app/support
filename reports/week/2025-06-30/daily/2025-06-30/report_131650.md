### 1. Pieces desktop app slow/laggy, unresponsive Copilot chat
Users report slow performance and unresponsiveness in the Pieces desktop app, especially Copilot chat, after the latest update on Windows.  A hard reset does not resolve the issue. An error message mentions a 404 for Publisher Model `gemini-pro`. This suggests potential issues with the model connection or access.
