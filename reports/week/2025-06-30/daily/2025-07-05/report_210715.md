## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Core Services Fails to Open Due to WebSocket Error

### 2. Pieces Desktop update loop and Core Services 404 error
Users on macOS and Windows are experiencing issues with Pieces Desktop. On macOS, the update process gets stuck in a loop, restarting the app repeatedly. On Windows, users are unable to open Pieces Core Services due to a WebSocketException with a 404 error when connecting to the local server.  Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and potential solutions.
