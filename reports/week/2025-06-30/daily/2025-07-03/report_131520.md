## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces Core Services Fails to Open Due to WebSocket Error
Multiple users reported a WebSocketException with a 404 HTTP status code when attempting to open Pieces Core Services. The connection to 'http://127.0.0.1:39300/user/last_checked_in/stream#' fails to upgrade to a websocket.  While installation succeeded, the PiecesOS version remains unknown.  Users are on Windows 10 with varying builds and hardware configurations. Further investigation into the server-side and potential port conflicts is needed.
