Yesterday I restarted pieces for the first time in weeks, and it said I needed to sign in before I can continue.\nFirst the sign in link wouldn't work. Then I noticed there was a Pieces OS update too. After I clicked that update I got back to the same screen and the link would work.\nSo I entered my mail address and it said I should get a verification code, which never arrived. So I tried again later and still nothing happened. I decided to let it rest until today and try it again, but still the same result.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.

  "recommendations": [
    "Prioritize resolving the 'Pieces OS and application performance issues' as it has the highest frequency and impacts Windows users significantly. Investigate system compatibility, reinstallation processes, and potential bugs introduced in the latest update.",
    "Address the 'Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities' issue affecting macOS users. Focus on improving data indexing and retrieval within workstreams, ensuring Copilot correctly interacts with multiple activities and respects time range selections.",
    "Investigate and resolve the authentication and startup issues, particularly for Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Windows and macOS.  Test the authentication flow, verification code delivery, and address any generic error messages.  Ensure the application launches reliably after extended offline periods.",
    "Address the high-activity tickets, starting with #716 (LLM code generation issues) and #315 (slow/laggy desktop application).  These tickets likely represent broader user pain points.",
    "Improve error messaging and logging, especially for authentication issues and application crashes.  More specific error codes and log details will help in faster diagnosis and resolution.",
    "Gather more data on user environments (OS versions, hardware specs) to identify patterns and potential platform-specific issues.",
    "Consider adding troubleshooting steps to the documentation or FAQs for common issues like application crashes, slow performance, and authentication problems."
