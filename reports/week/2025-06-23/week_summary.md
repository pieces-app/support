## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS Bugs and Performance Issues
Users are experiencing various issues with Pieces OS, including login failures due to verification codes not arriving, significant performance slowdown in VS Code extension after sending multiple messages, and inability to update last week's tasks in workstreams.  The login issue might be related to server-side problems or email delivery issues. The performance issue in VS Code could be due to memory leaks or inefficient resource management. The workstream issue may stem from data synchronization or caching problems. Further investigation is needed for all reported issues.
