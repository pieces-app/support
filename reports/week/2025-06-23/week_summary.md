## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or interact correctly with workstream activities, especially when generating reports or updating past tasks.  Issues include time range selection being ignored and difficulties accessing multiple activities simultaneously.  While single activity access via the 'start copilot chat' button may function, broader activity integration remains problematic.  This affects daily work reporting and task management.

### 2. LLMs and Pieces OS Issues
Users report problems with LLMs not generating complete or correct code.  Additionally, Pieces OS has startup failures on Windows and dependency verification issues on macOS. Reinstallation and restarting do not resolve the OS problems. Further investigation is needed into LLM code generation and Pieces OS stability across platforms.

### 3. Pieces OS Performance Issues and Failure to Launch
Users report Pieces OS performance degradation in VS Code after multiple Copilot messages, leading to slow UI and high resource usage.  Others report Pieces OS failing to launch on Windows and macOS after updates or reinstallation.  Suggested solutions include checking system resources, reinstalling Pieces OS, and verifying compatibility with VS Code extensions and OS versions.

### 4. Authentication and Startup Issues in Pieces OS 12.0.0
Users are experiencing difficulty authenticating or starting Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Windows and macOS.  Authentication errors include failure to receive verification codes and generic error messages during the authentication flow.  Startup issues involve the application failing to launch or requiring login after extended offline periods.  Suggested troubleshooting includes checking firewall settings, reinstalling the application, and verifying network connectivity.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
- [#759](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/759): Can't login/authentication message won't arrive

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving issues related to Copilot's interaction with workstream activities, as this impacts core user workflows.
- Investigate and address the root causes of Pieces OS startup failures on Windows and macOS, ensuring consistent performance across platforms.
- Improve LLM code generation accuracy and completeness to address user frustrations.
- Streamline the authentication process for Pieces OS, minimizing errors and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Optimize Pieces OS performance within VS Code, particularly after extended Copilot usage, to prevent UI slowdowns and high resource consumption.
