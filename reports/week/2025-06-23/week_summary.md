## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or interact correctly with workstream activities, especially when generating daily work reports or updating past tasks.  Issues include time range selection being ignored and inability to access multiple activities simultaneously.  While using "start copilot chat" within a single activity may work, the broader functionality appears broken.  This affects both macOS and Windows users.

- [#763](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/763): Workstream activity can't update last week tasks
- [#716](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/716): llms won't provide me the full code i need

### 2. LLMs and Pieces OS Issues
Users report problems with LLMs not generating complete or correct code.  Additionally, Pieces OS has startup failures on Windows and dependency verification issues on macOS. Reinstallation and restarting do not resolve the OS problems. Further investigation is needed into LLM code generation and Pieces OS stability across platforms.

- [#770](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/770): verify dependiencies

### 3. Pieces OS Performance Issues and Failure to Launch
Users report Pieces OS performance degradation in VS Code after multiple Copilot messages, leading to slow UI and high resource usage.  Others report Pieces OS failing to launch on Windows and macOS after updates or reinstallation.  Suggested solutions include checking system resources, reinstalling Pieces OS, and verifying compatibility with latest updates.

### 4. Authentication and Startup Issues in Pieces OS
Users are experiencing difficulty authenticating or starting Pieces OS.  Authentication issues include errors during the authentication flow and verification codes not being received. Startup issues involve the OS failing to launch after installation or update.  Potential solutions include checking firewall settings, reinstalling the application, and verifying network connectivity.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
- [#759](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/759): Can't login/authentication message won't arrive

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving issues related to Copilot's interaction with workstream activities (affects macOS and Windows users).
- Investigate and address the root cause of Pieces OS startup failures on Windows and dependency verification issues on macOS.
- Improve LLM code generation accuracy and completeness to address user reports of incomplete or incorrect code.
- Address Pieces OS performance degradation in VS Code after multiple Copilot messages, focusing on UI responsiveness and resource usage.
- Troubleshoot and resolve authentication issues, including errors during authentication flow and verification code delivery problems.
