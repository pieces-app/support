## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate workstream activity data, especially when selecting specific time ranges or multiple activities.  The issue appears across macOS devices and different Pieces OS versions (4.2.1, 12.0.0).  While using 'start copilot chat' within a single activity sometimes works, the broader functionality is broken.  Users are unable to generate daily work reports or update past week's activities.  Potential solutions include checking data sync, Copilot permissions, and workstream activity data integrity.

### 2. Pieces OS v12.0.0 performance and login issues
Users are reporting issues with Pieces OS v12.0.0, including failure to launch on Windows after reinstallation, login problems on macOS due to verification code not arriving, and UI slowdowns in VS Code extension after sending multiple messages.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root causes and solutions.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Copilot's inability to access workstream activities, especially on macOS and across different Pieces OS versions (4.2.1, 12.0.0), as this impacts daily work reporting and updating past activities.
- Investigate and address the login issues with Pieces OS v12.0.0, including verification code delivery failures on macOS and launch problems on Windows after reinstallation.
- Improve the performance of the Pieces OS for VS Code extension, particularly after sending multiple messages, to address UI slowdowns and high resource usage.
- Check data sync, Copilot permissions, and workstream activity data integrity to potentially resolve the workstream access issue.
- Ensure the Pieces OS backend services are running correctly and investigate any potential issues with authentication and verification code delivery systems.
