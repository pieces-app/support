## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and application performance issues
Users report issues with Pieces OS not running after multiple attempts and reinstallation on Windows.  Additionally, the desktop application is slow, laggy, and unresponsive, especially after the latest update.  LLMs are also not providing complete or correct code. Troubleshooting may include checking system compatibility, reinstalling/updating software, and verifying LLM usage.

### 2. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or interact correctly with workstream activities, especially when generating daily work reports or refreshing past activities.

This affects macOS users on Pieces OS version 4.2.1.
