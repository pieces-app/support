## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot fails to utilize workstream activities data
Copilot cannot access or process workstream activity data, especially when selecting multiple activities or specific time ranges.  This prevents features like daily work reports from functioning correctly. Issue observed on macOS desktop application (version 4.2.1). Potential solutions include checking data access permissions, verifying Copilot integration with workstreams, and ensuring data consistency across different timeframes.
