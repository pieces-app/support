## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot fails to utilize workstream activities data
Copilot cannot access or process workstream activity data, especially when generating daily work reports.  It fails to find activities within the workstream, regardless of time range selection.  While using "start copilot chat" within a specific activity works, using it with multiple activities does not.  This issue has persisted for several days and may be related to recent updates or dependencies.

- [#770](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/770): verify dependiencies

### 2. Pieces OS startup failures after update
Users on macOS and Windows report Pieces OS failing to start or respond after recent updates, including the Tahoe beta.  Issues include slow startup, constant restarts, and complete unresponsiveness. Reinstallation has not resolved the problem for some users. Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and potential solutions.

### 3. Pieces OS Performance Issues and Failure to Launch
Users report Pieces OS performance degradation in VS Code after multiple Copilot messages, leading to slow UI and high resource usage.  Others report Pieces OS failing to launch on Windows and macOS after updates or reinstallation.  Suggested solutions include checking system resources, reinstalling Pieces OS, and verifying compatibility with latest updates.

### 4. Authentication and Startup Issues in Pieces OS 12.0.0
Users are experiencing difficulty authenticating or starting Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Windows and macOS.  Authentication errors include failure to receive verification codes and generic error messages during the authentication flow.  Startup issues involve the application failing to launch or requiring login after extended offline periods.  Potential solutions include checking firewall settings, trying different browsers, reinstalling the application, and verifying network connectivity.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Pieces OS startup failures impacting both macOS and Windows users. This is a critical issue affecting core functionality and requires immediate attention.
- Investigate the Copilot's inability to access workstream activity data. This impacts daily work reporting and hinders user productivity.
- Address the authentication issues in Pieces OS 12.0.0, including verification code delivery failures and generic error messages. This blocks new users and returning users after offline periods.
- Improve Pieces OS performance, particularly in VS Code after multiple Copilot messages. High resource usage and slow UI degrade the user experience.
- Monitor and address any recurring issues related to recent updates or the Tahoe beta. This proactive approach can prevent widespread user frustration.
