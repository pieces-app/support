## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or interact correctly with workstream activities, especially when generating daily work reports or updating past tasks.  Issues include time range selection being ignored and inability to access multiple activities simultaneously.  While single activity access via the 'start copilot chat' button may function, broader activity integration remains problematic.  This affects macOS users on Pieces OS version 4.2.1.

### 2. LLMs and Pieces OS Issues
Users report problems with LLMs not generating complete or correct code.  Additionally, Pieces OS has startup failures on Windows and dependency verification issues on macOS, requiring restarts.  Further investigation is needed into LLM code generation and Pieces OS stability across platforms.

### 3. Pieces OS Performance Issues and Crashes on Windows
Multiple users report performance degradation, crashes, and failure to launch Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Windows.  VS Code extension users experience slowdowns after multiple Copilot messages.  Desktop application crashes occur when moving the window or scrolling. Some users cannot launch the application at all.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and potential solutions.

### 4. Pieces OS and Desktop App Crashing/Not Running on Windows and macOS
Users report Pieces OS and Desktop App crashing when scrolling, moving windows (Windows), or not launching at all after updates (Windows, macOS). Issues appear across Pieces OS 12.0.0 and Pieces for Developers 4.2.1, potentially related to Tahoe beta update on macOS.  Further investigation needed to pinpoint the root cause and provide solutions.

**Related Issues:**

### 5. Authentication and login issues across platforms
Users are experiencing difficulty logging in or authenticating with Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Windows and macOS. Issues include authentication flow errors, verification emails not arriving, and the application not running after update/reinstallation.  Further investigation into authentication services and OS compatibility is needed.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
- [#759](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/759): Can't login/authentication message won't arrive
- [#766](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/766): Pieces OS is not running even after several attempts and reinstallation


## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the Pieces OS crashing issue on Windows (especially version 12.0.0) impacting scrolling and window movement.
- Investigate and address the authentication flow errors and email delivery problems affecting both Windows and macOS users.
- Focus on fixing Copilot's integration with workstream activities, particularly its inability to access multiple activities and handle time ranges correctly on macOS.
- Improve LLM code generation accuracy and completeness to address user reports of incomplete or incorrect code.
- Investigate Pieces OS startup failures on Windows and dependency verification issues on macOS after updates, including the Tahoe beta impact.
