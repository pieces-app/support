Users are experiencing performance degradation in the VS Code extension after sending multiple messages, leading to slow UI and increased resource usage.  Additionally, some users are unable to log in due to verification code delivery failures.  One user reported issues updating workstream activity with an older Pieces OS version (4.2.1).
