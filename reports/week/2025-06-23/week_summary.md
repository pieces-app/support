## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and application performance issues
Users report issues with Pieces OS not running after multiple attempts and reinstallation on Windows.  Additionally, the desktop application is slow, laggy, and unresponsive, especially after the latest update.  LLMs are also not providing complete or correct code. Troubleshooting steps include checking logs, reinstalling, and ensuring sufficient system resources.

### 2. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or utilize workstream activity data, especially when requesting summaries or reports.  Issues include time range selection being ignored and inability to access past activities.  While single activity access via the 'start copilot chat' button may work, multi-activity access is problematic. This affects daily work reporting and updating past tasks. The issue appears across macOS and potentially other platforms.

Multiple users report Pieces for Windows crashing when moving between screens or scrolling, failing to launch after installation, or experiencing significant lag and slow response times, especially in Copilot chat. Issues reported across different Pieces OS versions (10.0.1, 12.0.0).  Further investigation needed to identify root cause and potential solutions.
