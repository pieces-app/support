## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces OS and application performance issues
Users report issues with Pieces OS not running after multiple attempts and reinstallation on Windows.  Additionally, the desktop application is slow, laggy, and unresponsive, especially after the latest update.  LLMs are also not providing complete or correct code. Troubleshooting may include checking system compatibility, reinstalling, or reverting to a previous version.

### 2. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or interact correctly with workstream activities, especially when generating daily work reports or updating past tasks.  Issues include time range selection being ignored and inability to access multiple activities simultaneously.

Further investigation into data indexing and retrieval within workstreams is needed.
