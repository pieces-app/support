## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot fails to utilize workstream activities
Copilot cannot access or process workstream activity data, especially when selecting multiple activities or specific time ranges.  This issue prevents accurate daily work reports.  The problem appears to have started recently and persists across multiple user reports.  A potential workaround is using the 'start copilot chat' within individual activities, but this doesn't solve the broader issue.
