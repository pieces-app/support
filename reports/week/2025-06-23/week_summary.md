## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot struggles to access and utilize workstream activities
Users report Copilot failing to locate or interact correctly with workstream activities, especially when generating daily work reports or refreshing past activities.  Issues involve time range selection and accessing multiple activities simultaneously.  While single activity access via the 'start copilot chat' button may function, broader activity integration remains problematic.  This affects macOS users on Pieces OS version 4.2.1.

- [#716](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/716): llms won't provide me the full code i need

### 2. LLMs and Pieces OS Issues
Users report problems with LLMs not generating complete or correct code. Additionally, Pieces OS has startup failures on Windows and dependency verification issues on macOS, requiring restarts.  Further investigation is needed to determine root causes and solutions for both LLM and Pieces OS issues.

### 3. Pieces OS Performance Issues and Failure to Launch
Users report Pieces OS performance degradation in VS Code after multiple Copilot messages, leading to slow UI and high resource usage.  Others report Pieces OS failing to launch on Windows and macOS after updates or reinstallation.  Suggested solutions include checking system resources, reinstalling Pieces OS, and verifying compatibility with latest updates.

### 4. Authentication and Startup Issues in Pieces OS 12.0.0
Users are experiencing difficulty authenticating or starting Pieces OS 12.0.0 on Windows and macOS.  Authentication errors include failure to receive verification codes and generic authentication flow errors.  Startup issues involve the application failing to launch or the OS not running after installation.  Suggested troubleshooting includes checking firewall settings, trying different browsers, reinstalling the application, and verifying network connectivity.

**Related Issues:**
- [#769](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/769): An error occurred in the authentication flow.
