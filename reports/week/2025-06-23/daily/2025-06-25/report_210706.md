## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot fails to utilize workstream activities
Copilot cannot access or process workstream activity data, especially when selecting multiple activities or specific time ranges.  This issue prevents accurate daily work reports.  The problem appears to affect macOS desktop application version 4.2.1.  Potential solutions include checking data access permissions, verifying Copilot integration with workstreams, and ensuring data consistency within the workstream database.

### 2. macOS App Issues & Pieces OS Problems
Users are experiencing issues with the desktop application on macOS, including Pieces OS failing to run or respond after the latest Tahoe beta update.  Additional problems involve difficulty updating last week's workstream activities. Troubleshooting may involve verifying dependencies, restarting the application, or checking for compatibility with the latest OS and Tahoe beta versions.

### 3. Authentication and Startup Issues in Pieces OS
Users are experiencing authentication errors ("An error occurred in the authentication flow") on Windows 11 and application startup failures on macOS after the latest Tahoe beta update.  The authentication error occurs on new installations and affects both Firefox and Edge browsers.  The macOS startup issue renders the application unresponsive.  Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and potential solutions for both issues.

- Investigate and address the macOS application and Pieces OS stability issues arising after the latest Tahoe beta update, including startup failures and slowdowns (Issues #768, #770).
- Troubleshoot and fix the authentication flow error encountered by new Windows 11 users on Firefox and Edge browsers (Issue #769).
- Address the issue of workstream activities not updating correctly for past tasks (Issue #763).
- Improve communication with users regarding ongoing issues and expected resolution timelines.
