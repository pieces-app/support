## Common Issues
### 1. Copilot fails to utilize workstream activities data
Copilot cannot access or process workstream activity data, especially when generating daily work reports.  It fails to find activities within the workstream, regardless of time range selection.  While using "start copilot chat" within a specific activity works, it doesn't function with multiple activities.  Refreshing or selecting different time ranges does not resolve the issue. This affects daily report generation and historical activity access.
