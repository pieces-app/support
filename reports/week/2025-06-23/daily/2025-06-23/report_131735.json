One user on Windows (OS version 12.0.0) and another on macOS (OS version 4.2.1) reported similar performance degradation.  The VS Code user encountered slow UI response, keyboard input lag, and delayed LLM responses. The macOS user couldn't update last week's activities. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and potential solutions.",

CPU usage and RAM usage also spikes when this occurs.\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
