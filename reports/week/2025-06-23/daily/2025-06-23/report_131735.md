## Common Issues
### 1. Performance Issues in Pieces OS and VS Code Extension
Users are experiencing slow performance and high resource usage in Pieces OS, particularly within the VS Code extension after sending multiple messages to Pieces Copilot.  One user on Windows (OS version 12.0.0) and another on macOS (OS version 4.2.1) reported similar performance degradation.  The VS Code user encountered slow UI response, keyboard input lag, and delayed LLM responses. The macOS user couldn't update last week's activities. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and potential solutions.

## Recommendations
- Investigate performance issues in Pieces OS and VS Code extension, especially after multiple Copilot messages. Focus on high resource usage and UI slowdowns.
- Address the inability to update last week's activities in the Workstream feature on macOS.
- Prioritize resolving issues affecting Windows (OS version 12.0.0) and macOS (OS version 4.2.1) users.
