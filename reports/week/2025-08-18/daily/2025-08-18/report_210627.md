## Recommendations
- Prioritize debugging the Pieces launch failure on Ubuntu 24.04 (Issue #835) due to its high activity level and impact on new users.
- Investigate the authentication site connection failure during Pieces installation on Windows (Issue #834) to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.
- Address the MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool's failure to extract context (Issue #747) to enable its intended functionality.
- Review network connectivity and firewall settings as potential solutions for the common launch and connection issues.
- Check GTK versions on Ubuntu 24.04 and Pieces OS logs for potential conflicts contributing to the crash.
- Improve documentation and error messages related to installation and launch issues to provide clearer guidance to users.
