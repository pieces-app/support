The installation issue appears related to network security measures, while the LTM issue seems to be a server-side problem with the MCP tool implementation. Suggested solutions include checking network security settings and investigating the MCP server's interaction with the LTM data access layer.",

Verify MCP Server is Running\n```bash\nlsof -i :39300\n# Shows Pieces OS listening on port 39300 with multiple established connections\n```\n\n### 2. Confirm Tools are Available\n```bash\ncurl -N http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse \\\n  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' &\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tools/list\"}'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 Successfully returns tools list with `ask_pieces_ltm` tool schema\n\n### 3. Test create_pieces_memory (Working)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"create_pieces_memory\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"summary\":\"Test memory\",\n        \"summary_description\":\"Testing connection\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u2705 `\"Long term memory successfully created\"`\n\n### 4. Test ask_pieces_ltm (Failing)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/messages \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":3,\"method\":\"tools/call\",\n    \"params\":{\n      \"name\":\"ask_pieces_ltm\",\n      \"arguments\":{\n        \"question\":\"What did I work on today?\",\n        \"chat_llm\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Result:** \u274c `{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Failed to extract context\"}],\"isError\":true}`\n\n## Attempted Variations (All Failed)\n\n### Minimal Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"hello\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"\n}\n```\n\n### With Application Sources\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What terminal commands have I run recently?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\"],\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\"\n}\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"What did I work on today?\",\n  \"chat_llm\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"connected_client\": \"Warp\",\n  \"application_sources\": [\"Warp\", \"Google Chrome\"],\n  \"topics\": [\"terminal\", \"commands\", \"recent\"],\n  \"related_questions\": [\"What was I working on?\", \"What debugging was I doing?\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Different Application Sources Tested\n- `[\"Warp\"]`\n- `[\"Google Chrome\", \"Safari\", \"Obsidian\"]`\n- `[\"Claude\"]`\n- Multiple combinations from the schema list\n\n**All variations return the same error.**\n\n## Troubleshooting Attempted\n\n1. \u2705 **Restarted Pieces MCP server** - Issue persists\n2. \u2705 **Verified Pieces OS permissions** - Has necessary macOS permissions\n3. \u2705 **Confirmed LTM data collection** - User sees active workstream data\n4. \u2705 **Tested different MCP clients** - Same error in Warp Agent Mode, Claude, and direct curl\n5. \u2705 **Used proper SSE endpoint** - `/sse` for responses, `/messages` for requests\n6. \u2705 **Verified JSON-RPC format** - Matches working `create_pieces_memory` calls\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `ask_pieces_ltm` tool should return contextual information from the user's LTM data, similar to how the main Pieces application shows workstream summaries and context.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nEvery call to `ask_pieces_ltm` returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Failed to extract context\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis appears to be an **MCP server implementation issue** where:\n\n1. The `ask_pieces_ltm` tool is properly registered and callable\n2. The MCP communication protocol works correctly\n3. The underlying LTM system has data and functions properly\n4. There's a disconnect between the MCP tool implementation and the LTM data access layer\n\n## Potential Root Causes\n\n1. **Authentication/Session Issue**: MCP server process may lack proper authentication to access LTM data\n2. **Data Access Layer Bug**: `ask_pieces_ltm` implementation may be using incorrect API calls to access LTM\n3. **Permissions Issue**: MCP server may not have the same data access permissions as the main Pieces application\n4. **Initialization Problem**: LTM access for MCP tools may require additional setup or initialization\n\n## Request\n\nPlease investigate the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool implementation in the Pieces MCP server to identify why it cannot access the same LTM data that is clearly available to the main Pieces application.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Issue occurs consistently across different MCP clients (Warp, Claude)\n- `create_pieces_memory` works perfectly, confirming MCP communication\n- LTM is actively collecting and displaying data in the main Pieces app\n- No relevant error logs found in system logs or Pieces application logs\n- Multiple parameter variations attempted with identical results\n\n\nError generating summary: 404 Publisher Model `projects/pi3c3s-cloud-server/locations/us-east1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro` was not found or your project does not have access to it.
