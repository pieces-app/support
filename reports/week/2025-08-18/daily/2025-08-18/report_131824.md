| [#834](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/834) | Cannot connect to Authentication site during install of Pieces | 3.48 |
| [#747](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/747) | MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" despite functional LTM | 2.94 |

## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces fails to connect to authentication site or LTM
Users are experiencing connectivity issues with Pieces, either during installation (failing to connect to the authentication site) or when using the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool (failing to extract context from a functional LTM).  The installation issue appears related to network security measures, while the LTM issue seems to be a server-side problem with the MCP tool implementation. Suggested solutions include checking network security settings and investigating the MCP server's interaction with the LTM data access layer.

- [#747](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/747): MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool consistently returns "Failed to extract context" despite functional LTM


## Recommendations
- Investigate network security interference during Pieces installation, particularly for users on VDIs with Cortex XDR.
- Troubleshoot the MCP server's `ask_pieces_ltm` tool to resolve the "Failed to extract context" error and ensure proper LTM data access.
- Provide clearer documentation or troubleshooting steps for users experiencing connectivity issues with Pieces, including network security checks and LTM interaction verification.
