## Recommendations
- Investigate startup crashes on Ubuntu 24.04 (Bug 835).  Prioritize debugging the Pieces for Developers application on this platform.
- Address authentication issues during installation on Windows (Bug 834).  Verify compatibility with Cortex XDR and provide clear instructions or workarounds for users encountering this problem.
- Ensure Pro users can upgrade to the latest LLM version (Bug 818).  Investigate why the LLM is not updating correctly across different IDE plugins and desktop applications.
- Improve communication with users regarding LLM versions and capabilities.  Provide clear documentation or in-app messaging about the specific LLM being used and how to upgrade.
- Monitor network connectivity issues.  Gather more data on users experiencing connection problems during installation or usage to identify potential network-related bugs or dependencies.
