## Common Issues
### 1. Pieces installation and startup failures across platforms
Users are encountering issues installing or starting Pieces on Windows and Ubuntu. On Windows, installation fails due to a potential authentication site connection problem, possibly related to security software. On Ubuntu, the application crashes at startup with XCB errors, even after reboots.  Further investigation is needed into network connectivity issues and XCB compatibility on Ubuntu.
