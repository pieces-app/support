| [#805](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/805) | Bug: Subscription is not showing up within the Application(cancelation + resubscription w/ a new plan) | 8.07 |

## Common Issues
### 1. LTM query fails after extended use
Users report LTM queries failing after several weeks of use, returning nothing despite Workstream functionality remaining unaffected.  Clearing LTM data via the provided button does not resolve the issue. Reinstalling the application temporarily restores LTM functionality.  Issue potentially related to LTM size exceeding capacity.
