| [#835](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues/835) | pieces-for-developers crashes at startup on ubuntu 24.04 LTS | 7.48 |

## Common Issues
### 1. pieces-for-developers crashes on startup on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
The application crashes immediately after launch on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with X11 and Nvidia drivers.  Logs indicate potential XCB multi-threading issues and failure to load GTK modules.  The application's data directory isn't created.  Suggested solutions include checking GTK and XCB library compatibility, ensuring XInitThreads is called if using multi-threading, and verifying Nvidia driver compatibility.
