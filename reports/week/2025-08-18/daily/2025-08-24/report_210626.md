## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the LLM upgrade issue for Pro users. This appears to be the most frequent and active issue across multiple Pieces applications (Desktop, VS Code, Sublime).
- Investigate network connectivity issues, especially for users in regions with restricted internet access. The user report mentions VPN usage and potential proxy issues, which could be contributing to the LLM upgrade problem.
- Improve communication about LLM versions within the Pieces applications. Ensure clear messaging about which LLM is active and how to troubleshoot version discrepancies.
- Review the LLM upgrade process and documentation. Simplify the steps and clarify any potential conflicts or dependencies.
- Consider adding more detailed logging or diagnostics to the Pieces applications to help identify the root cause of the LLM upgrade issue more quickly.
