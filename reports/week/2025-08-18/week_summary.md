### 1. Pieces fails to launch or connect to LTM
Users report Pieces for Developers crashing on startup on Ubuntu 24.04, failing to connect to the authentication site on Windows during install, and the ask_pieces_ltm MCP tool failing to extract context on macOS despite a functional LTM.  Common issues include GTK version conflicts, network connectivity problems, and potential bugs in the MCP server implementation.  Suggested solutions include checking dependencies, firewall settings, and ensuring Pieces OS has necessary permissions.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize debugging the Pieces for Developers crash on Ubuntu 24.04 (Issue #835) due to its high activity level and impact on user experience.
- Investigate the authentication site connection failure during Pieces installation on Windows (Issue #834) to ensure a smooth onboarding process.
- Address the MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool's failure to extract context (Issue #747) to improve LTM integration and functionality.
- Review network connectivity and firewall settings as potential solutions for both installation and launch issues.
- Check GTK version conflicts on Ubuntu 24.04 as a possible cause for the crash.
- Ensure Pieces OS has necessary permissions on macOS to address potential access issues.
